<p>This book deals with ethics as a strictly natural
science, and particularly as a branch of mechanistic
psychology. It regards the realm of ethics as
coterminous with the arena of human activity, and
holds that the problems of conduct, being exclusively
man’s problems, are to be solved by the
methods of applied science. Moreover, since human
conduct is in the last analysis dependent upon
the postures and manœuvres of our muscle-fabric,
he who would understand ethics must first comprehend
something of the mechanics of the human organism.
Indeed, this book attempts to show, not
only that ethics and physiology can no longer be
studied apart from one another, but also that it is
the structure and functions of the human body which
have determined just what our ethical values are.</p>

<p>Such a program is not strictly original, for the
student of philosophy will readily find its antecedents.
Nevertheless, while many ethical writers
have heretofore given numerous intimations of a
mechanistic scheme in ethics, yet usually as they proceed
to discuss what are called higher things, they
seem to forget that it is the human body which performs
every human action, even those deeds which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</span>
move us most profoundly. No such faltering, we
trust, will be found in these pages. Indeed, it may
be stated at the outset that one of the fundamental
conceptions from which this book originated is that
the well-being of the physiological organism is the
final criterion of whatever is ethically valuable.</p>

<p>The title, “The Ethics of Hercules,” is doubly
symbolical. Those who have heard of this ancient
hero will immediately recognize the emphasis which
is placed upon that type of personality who with
strength, skill, and persistence works out the problem
that lies nearest at hand. Moreover, Hercules
the valiant, the thoroughbred who never once
shirked from his task, is here contrasted with Cinderella,
the patron goddess of all those ineffectual
dreamers, who, instead of balancing their ethical
books day by day, whimper after the supernatural,
and cultivate an inner life of subterfuge and disorder.
We hold here that no man can have freedom
given to him, but that he must earn it by positively
constructive, honest efforts to adjust himself to and
gain control of his environment. The motto of
Cinderella is, “Where you are not, there is happiness,”
while the motto of Hercules is, “Friends
lost, something lost; honor lost, much lost; pluck
lost, all lost.”</p>

<p>The realization that in all science many false
starts are made before a single true one is achieved,
makes for caution and vigilance. Seeing, however,
that the trend of ethical thought has been continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</span>
growing more and more mechanistic, it seems
not unlikely that we are at the beginning rather
than at the end of a chapter in the empirical science
of human nature. If this book utters no more
than the first sentence of that chapter, the effort
will not have been in vain.</p>

INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>It would be an impertinence for an amateur in
physiological science to assert that the significance
of ethical values can be understood only through a
study of the mechanics of the human body, were
not the ethical implications of physiology so numerous,
so compelling, and so plainly apparent.
Ever since anatomists and physiologists first began
to demonstrate that all the vital functions of man
were dependent upon his intimate structure; and
more recently that conduct and thought are in the
strictest sense of the term functions of man’s flesh,
they have been laying the foundations,—even if unconsciously,—of
a scrupulously natural science of
ethics. The purpose of this book is to attempt the
formulation of such a science.</p>

<p>There is little need to state that any proposal to
deal with ethics in a thoroughly naturalistic manner
will be met with considerable resistance. Although
it has been everlastingly recognized that human
conduct is the direct product of human bodies, especially
as is evidenced by our bestowal of rewards
and punishments on individually specified persons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
nevertheless, the opinion still widely prevails that a
man and his actions are two such different things
that the former cannot be defined in terms of the
latter. Against this naturalistic or mechanistic
view,—that a man <em>is</em> what he <em>does</em>,—several classes
of people tenaciously hold contradictory opinions.</p>

<p>There are, for example, those who consider ethics
as the humble handmaid of what is curiously termed
“revealed religion,” and who consequently hold that
all the knowledge necessary for the conduct of life
has long ago been vouchsafed us by Infallible
Wisdom. To such persons it is of no importance
that human nature has actually altered to such an
extent as to make it necessary to find new solutions
even for ancient problems; nor does it seem to occur
to them that the homage devoted to the past
may often be simply a pleasant way of escape from
the intellectual responsibilities of the present. A
mechanistic ethics plans to undermine the notion
that the ethical truth of one generation is necessarily
sufficient for the problems of the generation
that succeeds it, and aims to supersede it with the
view that man’s progress is dependent, not upon his
ability to escape from his problems, but rather upon
his ability to analyse and solve them.</p>

<p>Again, there are those who regard ethics solely
as a subject for philosophical discussion on the
basis of an ideal never illustrated by any one man,
but only conceived in abstract terms. “How should
the ideal man behave?” is the sole burden of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
discussion. Even the mechanist hesitates to condemn
this esthetic attitude toward conduct too severely.
For it is well known that thinking may involve
preparation for action, and that consequently
he who thinks out the best course of conduct in advance
may be more likely to act accordingly when a
real problem is to be solved. On the other hand,
the human body and brain are so constructed that
all fanciful romancing is necessarily tinged with
delusion to such an extent that he who conceives an
ideal apart from the actual is bound to lose his
orientation. And the sequel of this loss is everywhere
manifest in purely philosophical discussions
about ethics. In the effort to extricate themselves
from the verbalism in which they are entangled,
ethical theorists have invariably either rejected the
world as evil, or else they have dug themselves in
under a mountain of meaningless words. To all
such persons a mechanistic ethics seeks to restore
a glimpse of the reality they have sought in vain, by
showing that the highest ideals need not be in any
way fictitious.</p>

<p>Resistance to a naturalistic ethics may also be
expected from those biologists and physiologists
who regard the human body essentially as a corpse
animated by a psyche. These people are known
as vitalists, and their number is very great. The
customary gloom of these men is doubtless derived
from their attitude toward the human body, which
they know best either in the form of specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
preserved in alcohol, or microscopic slides of
slaughtered tissue. Now, to be sure, such objects
of intense study do not of themselves yield an
adequate picture of a living, thinking man. But
these morphologically-minded persons, instead of
pertinaciously remembering what manner of organism
they have slain for research, and instead of
keeping ever in mind that all human tissues actually
die while performing their normal functions, deem
it somehow necessary to postulate a vital, that is,
an immortal principle, which makes the organism <em>go</em>.
A more perverse logic does not arise even in the
realms of theology. Oddly enough, the conversation
of these men is not so happy as their metaphysic
might indicate. “No, no,” they will repeat
in a plaintive outcry, “you can never find the secret
of life.” The sentiment underlying such a remark
is not difficult for even a casual student of psychology
to detect. Moreover, logicians know that
when a man states a problem in terms of a mystery,
and seeks thereby to hinder the search for its
solution, he commits an error which has been called
“the fallacy of initial predication.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Obviously,
indeed, we have already found out fully a thousand
of the secrets of living matter,—for instance, its
principal chemical ingredients, its dependence upon
oxygen, its optimal temperature, its rate of dying
with different vital organs removed, and the like,—and
so when a vitalist speaks of “<em>the</em> Secret of Life,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
he simply shows that he is still a worshipper of
magic. Although the way of intellectual progress
lies in another direction, yet, since the majority of
mankind court mystery as a way of escape from the
“despotism of fact,” the vitalist can be expected
to lead a voluble resistance against a mechanistic
ethics. Nevertheless, even he can perhaps be induced
to recognize that although Psyche does seem
to regulate Homo, yet it is always the structure of
Homo that determines what manner of function he
shall manifest. And if the mechanist can elicit this
admission from the vitalist, he can at least maintain
his chief contention. Otherwise, seeing that the
mechanists are on the whole younger men than the
vitalists, nature’s own slow processes will have to
soften the asperities of this conflict.</p>

<p>Having thus begun our outline of a mechanistic
ethics by stating the chief points of its disagreement
with certain traditional ways of thinking, let us
now proceed to establish without interruptions the
foundations upon which this science of human conduct
is to be built. And first a word as to its antecedents.</p>

<p>All modern scientific thinking, which is essentially
a pertinacity of attention,—a dogged following
upon a clue sagaciously intuited,—is our heritage
from ancient Greek thought, and particularly from
Socrates. And it is quite a significant, though oft-forgotten
fact, that while almost all our scientific
inquiry has been directed toward the conquest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
physical nature, Socrates himself scorned to devote
his powers to any but the subjects of ethics and the
theory of knowledge. It is, then, something like a
return to the chief interest of Greek life to employ
the methods of general science in the analysis of
the ethical problem. “Know <em>thyself</em>” was the well-known
motto of Socrates; but it has required an infinitude
of other knowledge before we could see
clearly enough to know ourselves. Nevertheless,
we may now say that in thus employing modern
science strictly in the interest of ethics, the homage
to Socrates is no less profound than the implied confidence
in the trend of that civilization which originated
in his brilliant mind.</p>

<p>The antecedents of a naturalistic ethics, however,
are not all located in one man. With varying emphases,
we find similar tendencies appearing in
Aristotle, in Leonardo da Vinci, in Hobbes, in
Spinoza, in John Stuart Mill, in Herbert Spencer,
and in many other wise and kind men. Today this
same influence is more aggressive and expanding
than ever before. Lucien Levy Brühl, Edwin Holt,
John Dewey, William Morris Davis, George Clarke
Cox, and Roy Wood Sellars are typical representatives
of the movement devoted to making ethics
as objective as the science of mechanics. Consequently
it would seem that the attempt we shall
make here to define ethical values in terms of man’s
biological functions is not a forlorn hope, either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
historically unforeseen, or lacking contemporary
sympathizers.</p>

<p>What, then, is implied by the statement that
ethical values are to be defined in terms of man’s
biological functions? In the first place, we imply
that just as man’s body, by means of brain, sense
organ, muscle and gland, makes, upon stimulation,
all the mind it ever manifests, so likewise that same
body of man, through the mechanisms just enumerated,
creates ethical notions. That is to say, the
realm of ethics is coincident with the realm of human
behavior in so far as that behavior is judged
to be good or bad, right or wrong, virtuous or
vicious. Now the body of man performs many and
various functions, some of which are called physical,
some chemical, some mental, and some ethical; and
any structure of man’s body, such as an arm or a
leg, can be shown to perform all these four types of
function at the same time. Such a statement will
cause no surprise to those who have followed the
trend of psychological and ethical theory in the last
decade. And while it is obviously impossible to
prove any theory to the negatively suggestible
obstructionist, it is a very hopeful sign that today
great numbers of even untutored men are disbelieving
in the transcendence of mental and ethical
qualities, and are relocating them among the natural
phenomena of the world. Hereafter, then, we shall
also understand ethical values to be achievements of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
man’s mind, which is a function of his protoplasm,
which is a function of the sun.</p>

<p>A second implication of our basic assertion is
that since our knowledge of man has, after a hundred
false starts, just recently become in any way
accurate, so must our views on ethical questions
be regarded as still in the infancy of their truth.
Moreover, just as scientific inquiry in every other
field is subject to revision upon each new discovery
of signal importance, so must ethical science, during
the period of its infancy, be subject countless times
to an equally sweeping revision. In other words,
the scientific attitude toward ethics forestalls any
attempt or wish to draw on some phantom bank
account to eke out the ethical resources of mankind,
insufficient though such resources may at times appear
to be. He who, like the mechanist, believes
that virtue is a strictly natural phenomenon, must
not carry a-priori standards into his work, but must
believe that an accurate description of human nature
will furnish all the necessary data for an applied
science of human conduct. To be sure, since man
is a creature who likes and dislikes, who prefers
and rejects, this very fact precludes an ethics without
any mention of ideals of one sort or another.
Nevertheless, it is our particular business here not
to establish or insist on any set of ideals in advance
of an empirical study of human conduct, for it may
well be that what we call our highest ideals are, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the light of science, in need of considerable revision.</p>

<p>With this by way of introduction, we shall at once
proceed with the work already proposed. And just
as a new proprietor of an old business begins by
taking inventory, so shall we at once take stock of
the ethical resources of man. Our method for the
time being will be the method of the statistician.
Following the arrangement of our data as we find
them, we shall first seek to answer that most interesting
and, indeed, fundamental question, namely,
Why do our ethical judgments always occur in
pairs of antonyms? This enquiry will bring us to
the very center of the ethical problem. Next we
shall ask just what our ten principal ethical concepts
really mean, and shall seek to discover their relationships
to one another. Finally, we shall endeavor
to show how the knowledge thus derived,
when combined with insight into the mechanics of
body and mind, furnishes us with an ethical technique
which transcends both in scope and effectiveness all
that we have hitherto possessed.</p>

<p>It is a fact of the greatest significance that the
words by which we convey our ideas of value always
occur in pairs, one of which is the opposite of the
other. In esthetics the beautiful is contrasted with
the ugly, and the charming with the disgusting; in
logic the true clashes with the false, and in philosophy
the real with the unreal; in matters of public
and private economy the cheap is antithetical to the
expensive, and the generous to the miserly; while in
ethics we constantly hear the words good and bad,
right and wrong, virtuous and vicious employed to
denote the opposition and contradiction of human
interests and ideals. What is the ultimate reason
why we thus employ such pairs of antonyms in our
judgments of praise or blame, our expressions of
desire or aversion, and in our estimations of merit
or defect?</p>

<p>This modern question, upon which the founding
of a true science of ethics depends, cannot be answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
by any appeal to the speculative metaphysics
of bygone generations. We have passed out of
that period in which men were content with an explanation
based on the Zoroastrian hypothesis of a
world divided between the warring forces of light
and darkness, while our ears are now equally unresponsive
to the bi-polar principles of love and hate
which Empedocles propounded. Even our recent
Emerson’s “Law of Compensation,” born though it
was of canny, scientific thinking, is not marked by
the least sign of that finality which the answer we
seek should possess. It is, indeed, our conviction
that the presence of antonyms in human speech is
not to be accounted for by the assumption of a
theory concerning the world as a whole, but rather
by an examination of some of the baldest facts of
our everyday experience. Nay more, it is our declared
purpose to show that the metaphysical and
theological notions of Empedocles and Zoroaster
are themselves to be explained by reference to the
physics and the physiology of man,—in terms of the
structure and functions of the human body. But before
we can comprehend the significance of such a
thesis, it is first necessary to understand some of the
physiological mechanisms underlying thought and
speech.</p>


<h3><em>The Rise of Mechanistic Psychology</em></h3>

<p>Ever since William James employed the phrase
“the <em>stream</em> of thought” to describe mental phenomena,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the whole trend of psychology has been altered.
Not only did the wide-spread use of that
phrase result in the giving up of many traditional
beliefs in regard to things mental, but it also stimulated
the most profitable investigations in psychological
science. One of the most ancient of the
beliefs which it demolished was the belief in
Ideas as eternal, external, and immutable. According
to the notion of a stream of consciousness
(itself a variable conception), ideas are sensory
images which show individual variations, which
never are exactly repeated, and which have meaning
only when they refer or lead to some concrete
reality. This view, which finally replaced the ancient
Platonic conception, is now held by practically
all psychologists. Moreover, the influence of
James’ teaching was such as to show that will, intellect,
feeling, and the like were not separable parts
of a mind (i. e., faculties) which were capable
of acting independently, but were merely handy
words to indicate the various qualities of the stream
of thought. The stream flows swiftly,—call that
impulsiveness; it flows again broadly and deeply
with many glancing eddies,—call that deliberation;
it flows once more with swift descent and foam,—call
that strong feeling. Nevertheless, the stream of
thought is one stream, and mental phenomena one
and all specify its labile and fluid consistency. And
now let us see to what further developments this
striking conception has led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Obviously, the astute, enquiring person at once
asks, “What makes this stream of thought? To
what is its flowing character due?” At first it might
seem that one must despair of any satisfactory reply.
One feels as did William Harvey, almost
hopeless in his quest after the secret of the circulation
of the blood. But just as Harvey boldly experimented
with his eye on the critical features of
his problem, so have a multitude of keen investigators
devised test after test to discover the laws of
mental phenomena. And while we cannot yet say
that “Science has laid her doomful hand” upon all
of the intricate secrets of mind, nevertheless, it is
becoming more and more certain that the stream
of thought is just as much a bodily function as is
the breath-stream and the blood-stream. Strangely
enough, this conception is not brand-new. It was
Aristotle who said, “If the eye were an organism,
vision would be its soul.” Similar thinking is revealed
in our modern view that mind is a function
of the body, and that it depends upon the body for
its existence. It “is generated by the body as the
result of its immediate contacts with the environment,
in much the same way as electricity may be
generated by a turbine that has been placed in the
midst of a tumbling waterfall.” Moreover, the
stream-like character of thought, the play of feeling,
the linger and strain of deliberation and expectation
are due to the manner in which the storage
battery of the brain releases energy, and to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
way in which the muscles and glands transform it.
William James wrote in 1890, “All consciousness is
motor,” that is, it is dependent upon the expression
mechanisms of the body; and today we have demonstrated
the fundamental rôle of the muscles and
glands of the body in “the transformation of the
common energies of nature into the special energies
of mind.”</p>

<p>It can be seen at once that such a philosophy of
mind furnishes the most striking and far-reaching
ethical implications. If what we call our mental life
turns out upon close inspection to be dependent upon
bodily functions, it follows that conduct and thought
differ only in the degree to which the body is excited
to activity (molar motion). In a word, conduct is
overt (visible), while thought is covert (invisible),
behavior. Edwin Holt, in the “Freudian Wish,”
speaks of thought (‘wish’ as he terms it there) as
“<em>a course of action which the living body executes
or is prepared to execute with regard to some object
or some fact of the environment</em>.” (pp. 56-7.)
John Dewey voices a similar tendency in his “Human
Nature and Conduct” when he says that <em>bodily
habits do our thinking</em>. (Italics mine.) “The
habit of walking is expressed in what a man sees
when he keeps still, even in dreams.” (p. 37.)
Thus the old idols are tumbled to the ground. Over
the doorway of the Germanic Museum at Harvard
is the inscription: “Es ist der Geist der sich den<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Koerper baut.” Complete reversal of such an animistic
and subjectivistic sentiment is proposed by
Dewey when he declares that a man stands erect, not
because he wills to, but because he can. His willing
is the result, and not the cause, of the muscular contractions
which elevate the chest and keep it convex.
The old dualism of mind and body, and the older
superstition that mind rules matter, have both received
their death-blows. In their place a complete
mechanistic philosophy is now securely enthroned.
It would thus seem likely that a <em>natural history of
virtue</em> will not long hence be written.</p>

<p>Of all the vexed questions which psychologists
have had to answer, perhaps none is more difficult
than the question as to the place of language in the
mental economy. What is language for? How did
it originate? What is its relation to thinking? To
overt activity? It is at once apparent that the answers
to these questions are highly important to
ethics, since the words good and bad, right and
wrong, and the like, play such a prominent rôle in
our judgments upon our fellow-men. Neither does
it seem possible to understand why we employ these
pairs of antonyms until we know what the single
terms of the pairs signify. And while it will require
several of the following chapters to give a
satisfactory answer to some of the above questions,
it is readily agreed that our judgments of value are
employed principally for two purposes:—(1) to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
sort out some of the objects of the environment,
e. g., by calling these <em>good</em> and those <em>bad</em>, etc., and
(2) to indicate to other persons what kind of behavior
is to be expected of us with regard to the objects
thus designated. That is our common experience.
If a man calls a shop a <em>good</em> shop, his
future behavior toward it can be predicted. If he
calls his neighbor <em>vicious</em> he can be expected not to
leave his wheelbarrow or his lawn-mower out at
night. Moreover, if we know what sort of things
a man calls bad, virtuous, or right, his whole social
philosophy can be plotted from the data provided
by these particular judgments. To state it briefly,
speech becomes an instrument for the transmission
of <em>meanings</em>. Before we proceed further, let
us see just what this involves in terms of bodily
mechanisms.</p>


<h3><em>A Mechanistic Interpretation of the Meaning
of Words</em></h3>

<p>To the superficial observer of a man who declares
that something is cheap, or beautiful, or good, the
sight of his lips moving and the sound of the words
as they are produced might appear to be the whole
phenomenon. Nevertheless, if anyone were to look
carefully behind the scenes of this performance, one
would find a much more elaborate play being enacted
than is apparent on the surface. Just as we
know now from the findings of the physiologist that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
when the eye <em>sees</em>, far more structures than the
retina are affected, and just as we are now certain
that when the ear <em>hears</em>, many more organs than
the ear-drum and cochlea take part in the response
to the stimulus, so we are convinced that when the
words we speak have a meaning, a neuro-muscular
drama of a very elaborate character is being silently
performed within our skin.</p>

<p>Novelists and story-tellers of all ages seem to
have intuited this truth in their portrayal of human
emotions. They speak of “pent-up anger,” of
“stifled sorrow,” and they describe often in minute
detail the course of a passion that in seeking to get
adequate expression causes the face to flush, the
hand to clench, or the body as a whole to be violently
agitated. The Iliad and the Odyssey abound
in descriptions of this sort, and every novelist since
the days of Homer has felt the need of such portrayals
in order to make his characters understood. Indeed,
the cultivation of this technique is the essence
of dramatic art. But mark, that such emotions are
aroused not only when a person is confronted by the
physical facts of battle, murder, or sudden death,
for example, but also <em>by the bare mention of the
words or phrases</em> which appropriately describe such
catastrophes. The more carefully such a person is
observed, the plainer will it become that the agitation
which his body is covertly manifesting would,
if it were unhindered in its free expression, result in
an elaborate pantomine appropriate to the events<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
described by the story-teller. In other words, the
emotions which a thrilling narrative arouses are
substitutes for the overt activity which the auditor
might be expected to manifest were he actually a participant
in the scene described. When, then, we say
that a dramatic situation <em>moves</em> us, the description
is absolutely accurate. Indeed, from the most credible
scientific evidence we possess, the emotions which
are thus aroused are characterized by all the organic
stresses and strains which are present in the most
violent overt activity of which we are capable. We
inwardly writhe and tussle, we half-start one kind
of positive behavior, only to find it checked by the
initiation of its opposite,—in a word, we display on
a small scale all the conduct appropriate to the situation.
And this elaborate arousal to activity is, we
undertake to say, precisely what gives every dramatic
scene or narrative its meaning.</p>

<p>Dr. George W. Crile has coined the appropriate
phrase “action-pattern” to describe the mechanism
involved in the cases just cited. Crile’s “action-pattern”
is, indeed, practically identical with Holt’s
“specific response,” and with Titchener’s “motor
set,” of which phrases the latter two are today
familiar to most students of psychology. Briefly,
this action-pattern is simply a more or less fixed way
in which some part of the body produces a movement.
It depends principally upon the physical
structure of the part, as well as upon its muscle and
nerve supply, and secondly upon the habits of movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
which external stimuli have repeatedly produced
in it. Thus every healthy leg has acquired
the action-patterns of walking and running, and
some legs have in addition the patterns of kicking,
or of “stepping on the gas” in open level country.
What we call the most skilful parts of the body are
those which have the greatest number of action-patterns.
The hands, lips, eyes, and tongue could
on this point be properly called the reservoirs of intelligence.
Certainly in the evolution of man they
have played the strategical part. Moreover, it is
supposedly these action-patterns, these habits of
movement, which are aroused whenever we are said
to remember or imagine, to cogitate or ponder; and
this is, I take it, what Dewey implies when he says
that bodily habits do our thinking. I have elsewhere
shown<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> how one action-pattern of the human
hand performs yeoman service in this respect,
and it would not be difficult to demonstrate that
every action-pattern is capable of generating a multitude
of thoughts. When, then, we say that a novelist
or poet has portrayed a moving, tragic scene, we
shall now understand that he has re-aroused in us
bodily habits which we started to acquire when we
first became acquainted with grief.</p>

<p>While we do not claim that all cases of meaning
involve such wide-spread and imperative bodily disturbances
as those which occur in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
tragic or erotic situations, it is nevertheless a valid
inference that words which stimulate us to no activity
whatsoever mean nothing to us. Certain it
is, at least, that the more meaningful or significant
any word is, the more does it stir up latent tendencies
to action throughout our whole organism.
Political and religious slogans are telling examples
of this. “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!” “Remember
the Maine!” and “For God, for Country,
and for Yale!” have been for some persons phrases
of the maximal philosophic content. Moreover, the
same word may arouse different meanings (or
action-patterns) in different people, depending not
only on how the word is spoken, but also on the
mood of the auditor. It is a matter of common
observation that the shout of “Fire!” calls forth by
no means the same responses from an insured landlord
as it evokes from an uninsured tenant, while
the mention of <em>water</em> will stimulate one sort of
reflex action in a thirsty man, and quite another
sort in a man who has just been rescued from
drowning.</p>

<p>It is plain, then, that if physiological science has
achieved the least light upon the problems of psychology,
the meaning which any word or phrase possesses
is not something that the sound of the word
or its written symbol is endowed with, or something
that filters through from any Platonic realm of
ideas, but the meaning of any word is given to it by
the person who speaks or hears it. Moreover, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
endowment of meaning is implicit in the arousal of
action tendencies at the time when the word is
spoken or heard. In the example recently cited, the
word “fire” had a different meaning for the insured
landlord from what it had for the uninsured
tenant because the habits of precaution which the
former had acquired established a different motor
attitude toward fire than did the procrastination
of the latter. Consequently, the shouting and the
conflagration were stimuli in the presence of which
the landlord could be calm, while the tenant could
not.</p>

<p>The application of this principle of the dependence
of meaning upon action-patterns extends, however,
to other situations than those in which emotional
riots are observable. Indeed, we undertake
to say that even such plain, concrete words as <em>basket</em>,
<em>horse</em>, and <em>river</em> have a meaning because they
arouse us to motor activities of one sort or another.
It may well be, of course, that we start to think of
a basket in terms of its color, or shape, or its cost;
and of a horse in like terms; while we think of a
river only in connection with its height during seasons
of drought or flood: but eventually the basket
will, by implying <em>receptacle</em>, lead in our imagination
to the acts of filling and emptying; while the horse
will be finally pulling our loads or carrying our
weight on his back; and the river will be either
waded or swum by us, or become related to our necessities
or pastimes (our habits) in some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
manner. And when we thus develop a specific action-pattern
toward such an object, we are said to know
what it <em>means</em>. It has long been a maxim in education
that not until we know how to use and control
our environment, do we become fully intelligent towards
it. The theory and the fact of action-patterns
gives unusual support to this particularly profitable
maxim. Spinoza laid down the principle that the
will and the intellect are one and the same, and this
principle too has complete verification from mechanistic
psychology. Thought is dependent upon bodily
activity, and it does not matter for our present
purpose whether that activity be overt or subtly
concealed.</p>

<p>The question now arises: Does the meaning of
abstract terms, of the terms we use in our judgments
of value, consist in the same kind of motor tendencies
as those which are aroused by concrete terms?
From the following considerations I believe we can
say that it does.</p>

<p>To begin with, abstract terms are one and all the
result of the process of abstraction. This process
consists in our picking out some common feature or
quality from a great variety of objects, and giving
it a name in order to fix it in our memory. For example,
fire, the inside of ripe watermelon, and the
outside of ripe cherries may all be called <em>red</em>. The
concept, or abstract term, “red” can thereafter be
used on occasion as a gestural sign for all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
various objects when their color is being signified.
Moreover, the process of abstracting these common
qualities is itself a motor process. It is, physiologically
speaking, the same sort of activity as collecting
postage stamps or beetles’ wings. Indeed, the
simplest perception of any concrete object, any red
object, for example, involves motor activity of a
highly elaborate character. When we look at such
an object, not only is the retina of the eye stimulated,
but various muscles and glands are simultaneously
activated to an elaborate transformation of energy.
Likewise, when we hear, taste, smell, or have any
other perception, other characteristic transformations
of energy are taking place through the arousal
of action-patterns. Now we have just stated that
abstract terms are derived from the multifarious
perception of concrete objects. In what, then, does
the meaning of abstract terms consist? It consists
in their function of recalling some of the particular
experiences from which they were derived. Such
an abstract word as “red” has, then, a meaning for
us simply because it arouses in any of its phases
that particular action-pattern which all sorts of red
things have stimulated in us.</p>

<p>This same principle may now be applied to show
how even the meaning which attaches to the words
we employ to convey judgments of value may be
explained in physiological terms. For the highly
abstract character which the words <em>cheap</em>, <em>beautiful</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and <em>good</em> seem at times to possess is simply due to
the fact that at the mention of any such word we are
simultaneously stimulated to so great a variety of
actions that we are unable to follow any one of
them through to its conclusion. When such a condition
persists, the meaning is said to be vague.</p>

<p>It is, of course, not to be forgotten that every
time we use a word, whether we read it, speak it,
or hear it, the meaning it arouses is traceable to
the fact that firm bonds have been established between
the eye, ear, and throat mechanisms on the
one hand, and related parts of the body which are
involved on the other. This union of the reading-reflexes
with the somatic-reflexes is provided for by
a very simple mechanism called the conditioned reflex.
By such a device, any two reflexes which have
been aroused <em>together</em> frequently enough by external
stimuli will ever thereafter tend to arouse each
other. That is why the word “fire” which we all
were taught to use to indicate a certain kind of object,
will, even if spoken in a wilderness of snow,
make us feel some of the effects which flame once
produced upon us. Contrariwise, the blindfolded
man will, by no other cue than the touch of his
fingers, name such objects as carpet, leather, sandpaper,
and nails. And from what we have already
said about the source of the meaning of abstract
terms being traceable to concrete experiences, we
may now say that such words as cheap, beautiful,
and good, one and all owe their significance to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
fact that they too exhibit the law of the conditioned
reflex both in their origin and in their maturity.</p>


<h3><em>How the “All-or-none” Principle Helps to Disclose
an Amazing Secret</em></h3>

<p>It being thus apparent that words possess meaning
because they arouse motor tendencies in us, let us now
see what justification there is for the assertion previously
made that these motor tendencies need not
be at all visible as overt actions in order to perform
their epistemological function. This justification
is found in the all-or-none principle of nervous and
muscular activity,—a principle having the most far-reaching
consequences for both psychology and
ethics. We are all familiar with the fact that less
work is involved in lifting the arm leisurely to a
horizontal position than in moving it through the
same radius with a heavy weight held in the hand.
However, we are not all familiar with the fact that
in the case of the leisurely movement only a few of
the myriad nerve and muscle fibers of the arm are
being innervated, the rest being completely passive,
while in the case of lifting the heavy weight, the proportion
of fully active and inertly passive fibers is
just the opposite. But this is exactly the case. According
to the all-or-none principle discovered by
Lucas and Adrian,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whenever a single nerve fiber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
functions at all, it acts in its maximum capacity.
Never is such a fiber partially activated; in its all-or-none
functioning it is as uncompromising as
gravity. Consequently, even though the arm may
<em>feel</em> uniformly flabby when it is indolently moved
about, some few of its nerve and muscle fibers are
working to their limit.</p>

<p>This being the case, it is readily apparent that
the various qualities of muscular movement,—languid,
intentional, unintentional, or deliberate,—have
one and all a strictly quantitative basis. If a
man’s smile spreads out into a grin, this change in
the quality of his countenance is caused by the simple
addition of fully functioning neuro-muscular units
under the skin of his face. If the grin dwindles to
the smile, and that again vanishes into a look only
faintly reminiscent of pleasure, the opposite process
of subtraction is then taking place. Consider now
the further implications of this law of Lucas and
Adrian. For the logical inference is that when we
merely <em>think</em> of lifting our arm, but do not lift it
visibly, an essential part of the arm-lifting mechanism
has been nevertheless specifically stimulated to
activity; it is only because not enough muscle fibers
have been innervated to overcome the inertia of the
limb that the arm does not rise. That is, indeed,
our common experience. When we lie abed on a
cold winter morning and speculate on the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
of getting up, our imagination of the heroic deed is
perfectly of a piece with the real business of shivering
on the drafty floor. Indeed, according to the
all-or-none principle, since even the slightest neuro-muscular
activity is <em>positive</em>, the terms “overt” or
“covert” as applied to action refer merely to what
an observer can or cannot readily perceive. This
principle can be justly applied to the problem of
the meaning of words. The implication is sound
that even though the action-patterns which are
aroused by words are unfelt by us or invisible to an
onlooker, these motor tendencies are just as truly
positive physiological events, so far as they go, as
are the most violent efforts we openly manifest.
For the pattern of action is the same; the only difference
is in the number of nerve and muscle fibers
involved.</p>

<p>It was a motto of Jesus that “As a man thinketh
in his heart, so is he.” Although the particular
phrase, “in his heart,” is now regarded as too wild
a hyperbole to be justified by the facts, yet the all-or-none
principle furnishes an unsuspected substantiation
of the essential truth of this motto with respect
to certain individuals. We have long known
that thinking did somehow lead to action,—that
both the rogue and the philanthropist, the slanderer
and the coquette often schemed and planned secretly
for years without giving any outward hint of what
their future behavior was to be. History is full of
the trouble caused for those who had “no art to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
read the mind’s construction in the face” of him who
could “smile and smile and be a villain.” And now
the secret is out why for so many centuries it was believed
that thought produced action and mind ruled
matter. Thought <em>is</em> action, but action of so elusive
a character as to be totally beyond the unaided eye
to detect; and thought “leads” to action for the
same reason that a spark can produce a conflagration
and a hole in a dyke produce a flood. In all three
cases the greater effect is due to the magnification
of the exciting cause. The ancients held that mind
ruled the body for the reason that, being ignorant
of the fact of covert muscular responses, they assumed
an incorporeal cause for a series of events
whose end-term alone they were able to discern as
embodied in the movements of matter.</p>

<p>It is thus finally apparent how by means of the law
of the conditioned reflex and the all-or-none principle,
both concrete and abstract terms serve not only
as gestural signs, but also serve to imply and predict
human activities. We have shown that every word
which has a meaning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> implies action. It
matters not whether that action be sudden or violent,
or merely one that is carried out on “low gear,” so
to speak, by the neuro-muscular mechanisms of the
body. Neither does it matter whether that action
be precise or groping, specific or diffuse; if the word
has a meaning it will be accompanied by an action-tendency,
and that tendency will be added to the
kinetic potentialities,—the character,—of the individual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
For if it is the case that by the law of the
conditioned reflex, words <em>get</em> meaning, it is equally
to be asserted that by virtue of the all-or-none principle,
they <em>keep</em> it. Moreover, Holt to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is such demonstrable physiological
principles as these, and not the mysterious
Freudian categories, which are the keys whereby
the secrets of mind will be unlocked.</p>

<p>Having thus dealt with the problem of how the
neuro-muscular mechanisms of the body generate
and maintain the meanings of words, let us now
return to the original question of this chapter,
namely, What is the ultimate reason why we employ
such pairs of antonyms as “good” and “bad” in our
judgments of praise or blame, our expressions of
desire or aversion, and in our estimations of merit
or defect? Our answer is that the felt opposition
and contradiction of antonyms is due to the conflict
of motor tendencies, and in support of this theory
we cite a well-recognized physiological principle,—the
law of reciprocal innervation.</p>


<h3><em>The Physiological Explanation of the Opposition
of Antonyms</em></h3>

<p>Every freely moving part of the body, such as the
leg, the arm, and the head, is equipped principally
with two sets of muscles, called, from their functions,
the <em>flexors</em> and the <em>extensors</em>. The flexors
are those muscles which for example, upon contracting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
draw the legs and the arms toward the body
and fold them close to it, and which lower the head
upon the chest; while the extensors stretch out the
arms and legs, open wide the hands, and raise the
head to an erect posture. Other parts of the body
are similarly equipped for producing motions of an
opposite character in the skeletal system.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
eyeballs are lowered by the use of a different muscle
than that by which they are elevated; the muscle
which depresses the wings of the nose is a direct
antagonist of the other muscles which control the
movements of this organ, and so on throughout the
whole of our movable bodily structures. Moreover,
when one such pair of muscles is contracted,
the opposed member is normally relaxed, and vice
versa; or, as the physiologist would say, the two
muscles are reciprocally innervated.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>However, it must not be understood that this law
refers only to the visible contractions of the muscles
which produce the overt behavior of a man, for it
equally explains the case where a very small number
of nerve and muscle fibers are activated. That
is to say, the law of all-or-none <em>and</em> the law of reciprocal
innervation can both operate in the face
or the hand at the same time. Indeed, we must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
neglect to consider that <em>all</em> of the myriad fibers of
our largest muscles are never simultaneously contracted;
rather is it the rule that these fibers contract
in relays,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> thereby automatically saving us from
the fatigue and exhaustion which would otherwise
ensue. Moreover, the more intelligent and skilful
we become, or, as we sometimes say, the more our
head saves our heels, the fewer muscle fibers are required
to generate and maintain any specific action-tendency.
Consequently, then, the law of reciprocal
innervation can be exhibited in the antagonism
of extremely small muscular units, such as we have
postulated to be involved in certain cases of meaning
provided they be anatomically situated in the
correct position for producing antagonistic strains.
Now the experimental demonstration of the law of
dynamogenesis at the hands of Richet, Charcot, etc.,
revealed that just such slight movements of an opposed
character are produced when we merely
“think” of <em>up</em> and <em>down</em>, <em>right</em> and <em>left</em>, <em>in</em> and <em>out</em>,
and the like. In every case of this sort, some part
of the movable, skeletal system performs overtly
or covertly the appropriate movement, thereby giving
meaning to the word. We may therefore, unless
we read all signs incorrectly, safely affirm that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
whatever be the action-pattern which any abstract
term arouses in us, the antonym of that term, if
indeed it be its logical and physiological antonym,
arouses action-patterns of an opposite character.</p>

<p>Our physiological explanation of the meaning of
words and the contradiction of antonyms is now
complete. For if, as we have previously shown,
even abstract terms acquire and keep their meaning
by virtue of the reflex tendencies which they arouse,
it is likewise apparent that the basis of logical opposition
and contradiction is to be found by an examination
of the baldest facts of the physics and
physiology of the human body. In brief, then,
<em>antonyms are those words whose utterance stimulates
us so to react as to illustrate the law of reciprocal
innervation</em>. And this, moreover, is the only
reason why <em>cheap</em> is the opposite of <em>expensive</em>, <em>true</em>
the contradictory of <em>false</em>, and <em>good</em> the antithesis
of <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p>Two words more, however, remain to be said.
The first of these is, that the number of pairs of
antonyms we have in our vocabulary signifies how
many different pairs of antagonistic motor tendencies
or action-patterns we could, were we fully
aroused, overtly manifest. Since thought is either
a rehearsal for, or a rumination upon, action, it is
essentially a process which employs the same structures
of the body as those which are activated in
our buying and selling, our giving and taking, our
toil and our play. The second word is, that if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
be due strictly to our muscular architecture that
antonyms occur in human speech, we can now safely
affirm that any philosophy or religion which construes
the universe as divided between the warring
forces of light and darkness, or as everywhere illustrating
the bi-polar principles of love and hate, is
likewise based upon the law of the reciprocal innervation
of antagonistic muscles. Such philosophies
are, indeed, profound, since they attempt to
inscribe on the firmament the drama of man’s
limitations.</p>

<p>With this by way of introduction, we are now
prepared to examine the various terms by which we
are wont to convey our ideas of ethical value, in
order to see just what the words “good,” “bad,”
“right,” “wrong,” and the like really <em>mean</em>. And
while the difficulties of such a task are admittedly
great, yet the presumption is entirely in favor of the
methods of mechanistic psychology to give a strictly
scientific interpretation to the subject matter of
ethics.</p>

THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICATION
OF THE WORD “GOOD”</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“... The majority attend to words rather than to
things; and thus very frequently assent to terms without
attaching to them any meaning, either because they think
they once understood them, or imagine they received them
from others by whom they were correctly understood....
Wherefore, if we would philosophize in earnest, and give
ourselves to the search after all truths we are capable of
knowing, we must, in the first place, lay aside our prejudices;
in other words, we must take care scrupulously to withhold
our assent from the opinions we have formerly admitted,
until upon new examination we discover that they
are true.” <span class="smcap">Descartes</span>, “The Principles of Philosophy,”
LXXIV, LXXV.</p>
</div>


<p>What do we mean by the word “good”? That is
to say, how shall we describe the action-pattern
which the stimulus of this word arouses in us?
What does it mean when <em>we</em> use it, and what does
it mean to us when <em>others</em> employ it in their speech?
Before we can answer these questions, it is first essential
to scan the list of things to which this word
is applied, for only by so doing can we identify the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
term <em>good</em> with some specific function of the human
organism.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Although such a task is a difficult one, the difficulty
does not appear to be insurmountable. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
spite of the fact that nearly eighty significations are
possessed by this word, they will, nevertheless, if
pondered long enough, reveal some common core of
meaning. And if we now bear in mind that every
such synonym implies a motor mechanism that is
developing a specific attitude toward the environment,
we shall hope to find a true solution to the
problem of the meaning of the concept “good”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The term <em>good</em> is used as an adjective, noun, and
adverb, and occasionally (Ex. 15) as a verb; in addition,
it has sometimes an idiomatic significance, in
which case its exact status as a part of speech is
doubtful. These differences, however, need not
concern us here. <em>Good</em> has originally an adjectival
signification, and by derivation implies <em>fitting</em> or
<em>suitable</em>. This is highly important, for since <em>fitting</em>
and <em>suitable</em> exclusively describe things which help
us realize our purposes, we may consider the relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
between <em>good</em> and human behavior to be
inseparable. The type of action-pattern implied by
this word may also be faintly foreseen.</p>

<p>We have now the canvas stretched on which our
picture of <em>good</em> may be delineated. Let us proceed
to sketch in the first faint lines of the picture. In
the New Oxford Dictionary it is stated that <em>good</em>
is the “most general adjective of <em>commendation</em>,
implying the existence in a high, or at least satisfactory
degree of <em>characteristic</em> qualities, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
either admirable in themselves [sic!] or <em>useful for
some purpose</em>.” This definition succeeds far better
in combining the theory of the Epicureans (good is
what you like), of the Platonists (the good is the
typical), and of the Benthamites (the good is the
useful), than it succeeds in throwing a clear light
upon the question we are here attempting to answer,
namely, what sort of responses does the human organism
make toward those objects and persons which
it calls “good”? From Palmer’s definition of <em>good</em>
as “good <em>for</em>” (“The Nature of Goodness,” p. 13),
we are able to derive even less assistance, especially
since it avoids the main issue in containing the very
word to be defined.</p>

<p>Let us now attack this problem by a new method.
A survey of all the things which this word <em>good</em> indicates
reveals not only that it <em>denotes</em> (or simply
points out) a host of distinguishable objects and
properties, but that it also <em>connotes</em> (or implies) an
exceedingly numerous array of human activities.
And while the sum total of all these denotations and
connotations appears at first to be an unwieldy mass,
it can, I think, be suitably dealt with under the following
five classes:—</p>

<p>A. That which is useful, fit, serviceable, and the
like, for any purpose whatsoever. With such primitive
use of the term, the purpose involved is neither
praised nor blamed. The burglar’s jimmy is as
“good” for his purpose as is an overcoat to keep out
the cold. Some ethical writers refer to this as <em>immediate</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
as opposed to <em>remote</em> or <em>mediate</em> good, or
as non-moral as opposed to moral good. It is “good
<em>for</em>,” without any limitations as to what the “<em>for</em>”
implies. William James might have called it “decerebrate
good.”</p>

<p>B. That which is useful, fit, or serviceable in the
sense of being <em>continuously</em> or <em>continually</em> so. An
extended time being here introduced, <em>good</em> now becomes
almost synonymous with dependable. Our
concept here may refer to anything that sustains life,
or brings peace and contentment in society, and hence
at one moment it emphasizes intelligence and skill,
while at another it points directly to benevolent,
spiritual, and esthetic agencies. Moreover, it not
only denotes property (Ex. 28, “goods”), but also
frequently connotes an emotional enthusiasm in the
possessor of it.</p>

<p>C. That which fulfils expectation. This signification
is sometimes equivalent to “normal” or “typical,”
which terms are also frequently included in the
connotation of “useful” and “dependable.” But
here a distinctly new factor enters into the use of
this concept, namely, the tone of voice by which the
word “good” is uttered, for all colors and shades of
emotion and sentiment may be registered by this
means. Hence the concept “good” may be used to
imply that which just passably fulfils expectation,
or—</p>

<p>D. It may be used to indicate that expectation has
been greatly and even suddenly exceeded, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
case it sometimes denotes the presence of something
which is rated far above the normal, the immediately
useful, or the mildly beneficent (thereby
identifying itself with some of the significations exhibited
in Class B), or—</p>

<p>E. It may be merely expletive. Here the use of
the term “good” rapidly becomes exotic. It signifies
only surprise, shock, or spasm. “Good” as an
expletive also becomes closely allied with “good” as
an adverb, in which case its significance as a term
by which to express a judgment of value rapidly
evaporates.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>The Results of an Experiment to Determine Which
of These Five Classes Are Implied by the
Seventy-Nine Significations of the Word
“Good”</em></h3>

<p>The choice of these five classes was the result of
a test carried out over a period of several years.
Each one of the seventy-nine significations was
printed on a separate slip of paper, and then, first
choosing one of them at random, and employing
it as a tentative standard, the points of similarity
and difference between it and the remaining significations
were determined and recorded. From this
procedure there gradually arose, by differentiation
and condensation, the five classes we have just indicated,
which, as may be observed, are defined so as
to include as many and to exclude as few of the
uses of “good” as possible. Had our classes been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
defined with too great emphasis upon the meaning
of any single term of our array, the whole idea of a
classification would have had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Having thus determined upon these five classes as
representative and significant, one hundred college
students were asked to ponder these classes in connection
with the subjoined array of the common uses
of the word “good,” to choose one of the classes as
the one most appropriate in each case, and then to
choose as many other of these classes as seemed to
be involved, and to rank them in order of their importance.
For example, they were shown the first
two terms of the array,—(1) “Good food; fit to eat,
untainted,” and (2) “Good food; nutritious, palatable,”
and were asked whether they belonged in
Class A, B, C, D, or E. It was at once seen that
membership in more than one class was implied in
both cases, but it was also admitted that nutritious
and palatable food (No. 2) was a more dependable
“good” than was the food specified by example
No. 1. First choices were consequently indicated on
this basis. After that, second, third, and succeeding
choices were made for Nos. 1 and 2; following
which, the remainder of the array was treated in
the same manner.</p>

<p>The average of the results derived from this
experiment indicates that Class B (dependable
“good”) has a majority of votes, it being given
first place 49 times, and a subsidiary place 75 times.
Class C was given first place 20 times, and a secondary
place 65 times. Class A was the first to be implicated
in 5 uses of the word “good,” and was mentioned
as a later choice 26 other times. Class D
was voted to be the one most obviously implied only
2 times, but was mentioned in an associative relationship
59 times, while Class E, which received only
one vote, got that for first place. The importance
of Class B is thus clearly apparent. However, an
almost equally significant fact seems to be that there
were only five cases in which one class alone was implicated,
whereas two classes were used in 18 cases,
three classes were used in 34 cases, and four classes
were simultaneously implicated by 20 terms of this
array. The appended chart renders this distribution
and overlapping more obvious. From all this,
moreover, we seem to be warranted in inferring that,
with all the unlikeness there is between these various
synonyms for “good” when taken one at a time,
when taken all together (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub specie aeternitatis</i>, as
Spinoza would say) there is more of a common core
of meaning in them than one might naïvely expect.
Consequently, we may safely presume that if we can
satisfactorily define any one of the preceding five
classes of “good” in physiological terms, we shall at
the same time have hinted the definitions of all the
remaining classes.</p>

<p>In this connection one important thing must be
borne in mind. Which is, that in attempting to
reach our final definition of “good” we need only to
abstract the common characteristic,—in mathematical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
parlance,—the greatest common divisor of all
the particular uses for which this word is employed.
Consequently the definition we are searching for cannot
be expected to have any bias toward private or
provincial conceptions of the term “good.” It must
be catholic and unpartisan.</p>


<h3><em>The Action-Patterns Implied by the Use of
the Word “Good”</em></h3>

<p>We are now prepared to answer the question propounded
at the opening of this chapter: “What do
we mean by the word ‘good’? That is to say, how
shall we describe the action-pattern which the stimulus
of this word arouses in us?” For if we can
find out “what the organism is doing” when its vocal
organs are uttering this concept, we shall be able to
discover what the word “good” means.</p>

<p>It does not appear especially difficult to find what
we are now seeking. We have just given the total
array of uses to which this word is put, and we have
also reduced that array to some measure of coherence
by means of our five classes. Is it not, indeed,
a matter of the commonest observation just what
conduct human beings manifest when they use the
term “good” and signify thereby what is included in
Class A? It will be recalled that this class includes
“that which is useful, fit, serviceable, and the like,
for any purpose whatsoever.” Keeping our eye upon
the specific behavior patterns implied by this class of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“good,” we may now venture the following mechanistic
interpretation: <em>When a man is ready to perform
any action, he calls anything</em> GOOD <em>which assists
or furthers that particular action-tendency</em>.
Or, the same thing may be conveyed in the following
words: <em>Any stimulus that evokes a response we
are ready to make we are wont to call good</em>.</p>

<p>Any picture of the human race that one may draw
furnishes evidence of the cogency of this definition.
The child calls candy “good,” not because he knows
that sugar is muscle food, but simply because he
craves it, and sucks it in his mouth with avidity.
This mode of speech he got long ago from his parents.
His wanting the candy makes it “good” to
him when he gets it, because the candy is a stimulus
that evokes a response he was ready to make. The
boy of ten wants a top that will spin like those which
the other boys have, and he calls his a “good” top,
when it satisfies the action-pattern which he has been
developing. The rough youth of seventeen gives
his bullying chum a “good” punch in the eye, by
which he again means that the action-tendency he
was covertly developing toward him has been provided
a chance to expand into a full excitation. The
college man of twenty-two calls a dance tune a
“good” one, when, by its rhythmic effects it induces
him to caper and relax, and satisfy his semi-sexual
tendencies in public. And the old man of sixty-five
often speaks of his wife as a “good” woman, because
she has always had his dinner ready for him piping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
hot when, upon coming home, his whole alimentary
system was keyed up to perform elaborate acts of
chewing and swallowing. These and countless other
cases, taken from every hour of the day and night,
fully support the mechanistic interpretation which
we have just given. But mark, that no question is
in place here as to whether all such persons <em>ought</em>
to use the word “good” in such connections. The
fact that they <em>do</em> use it is, for the present, the only
essential item to be considered in an empirical science
of human conduct.</p>

<p>Just as when we enquired into the basic nature of
antonyms, we carried our investigation a little below
the surface of the organism, so may we here carry on
a similar study to advantage. It is obvious that the
readiness with which we respond to the objects called
“good” is necessarily dependent upon the integrity of
certain internal mechanisms, which, though never observed
in their uninterrupted working, have nevertheless
been deduced from a multitude of scientific
investigations. Moreover, it has been discovered
that every response we make is chiefly a function of
the muscular and nervous systems of the body.
How, indeed, would a child reach out for candy unless
his arm were an extensible hinge, and how could
it be extended unless something, namely, his triceps
muscle, pulled on the radial bone, and how also
could the muscle contract, unless a motor nerve from
the spinal cord were stimulated to perform this specific
activity? We do not, of course, specify that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the definition of “good” be restricted to imply only
this particular set of facts, but on the other hand we
stipulate that this significant mechanism be not lost
sight of by him who seeks without prejudice to understand
how ethical concepts originate. Even more
specific information than this is now available. Any
muscle that is ready to contract (or, as the vitalist
would say, to do Psyche’s bidding in attaining
Homo’s <em>good</em>) is said to be in a condition of tonus
or elastic tension. So far, then, as the muscles are
concerned, the “good” of Class A implies a normal
muscular tonus, which can, under the proper conditions,
be developed into a full contraction. Physicians
know that in both of the abnormal conditions
of tetanus and contractured tonus, the organism cannot
obtain some of the things which are essential for
its adaptation of the world about it. The possession
of a normal muscular tonus is, then, an ethical desideratum
of no mean importance.</p>

<p>Every such muscular contraction as we have just
described is brought about by means of a nervous
impulse, originating at a receptor organ, either external
or internal, which impulse proceeds toward a
muscle or a group of muscles. However, this impulse
(which in a sense may be thought of as a desire
on its way to fulfilment), is often subject to a
rather eventful history of interruptions before it
finally produces muscular action. Between the individual
nervous strands along the pathway of its
motion the impulse may encounter blockades, unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
electrically charged particles (called <em>ions</em>) are present
at the various gaps in considerable numbers.
Here again, then, we reach a further refinement in
our understanding of what one class of “good”
means. The “permeability of the synapses” (to
use a phrase descriptive of the above situation),
thus becomes a large determinant in human action.
And if one of the classes of our concept is definable
in terms of actions that are facilitated, the light
which neurology throws upon ethics is not to be
despised.</p>

<p>Our next adventure is the search for the various
implications of the term “good” as employed with
respect to Class B. This class, as previously stated,
involves the general notion of <em>dependability</em>. Things
of this class are nominally useful, fit, or serviceable,
not merely with reference to the desire of the moment,
but also and more particularly they are useful
for the future also. Nevertheless, this phrase, “useful
for the future,” must be taken to mean “imagined
as continuously or continually useful,” for although
we commonly regard tomorrow as a sort of package
that is coming to us in the mail, it is strictly something
not yet existing and consequently unreal. Just
as William James said, “The feeling of past time is
a present feeling,” so is the feeling of dependability
here to be interpreted not as a property of objects,
but as a condition of the organism. And, while no
incontrovertible evidence of the nature of such a
condition has yet been brought to light, it is directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
in line with the facts as we know them to assert that
the “good” included in Class B implies both a
maintenance of muscular tone and a steady permeability
of the synaptic membranes involved in the
action-patterns aroused by the things we keep calling
“good.” To which we might also safely add, that
the receptor organ requisite for initiating such an
energy transformation has also become so attuned
to receiving the stimulus as to show what the psychologists
call a lowered threshold. Suppose we
now condense this whole account, and state it more
pointedly by saying that Class B refers to those
objects that produce the responses for which the
organism has mobilized its maximum available energies.
Some of these dependable “goods” may
thus imply habitual responses, while others may
simply imply a craving long denied its overt satisfaction.
And I doubt not that between these two extremes
every man can find his own “highest <em>good</em>.”</p>

<p>In passing, it might be pertinent to remark
that the “good” implied by Class B is always <em>life-enhancing</em>,
were it not for the fact that this obtrudes
a standard not warranted by all users of this
term. For the snap judgment (or even the pondered
conclusion) of an exceedingly great number of people
makes money the chief dependable “good,” that
of others puts friends and companions in this category,
while with fewer still knowledge is so regarded.
Some of these things do not always turn
out to be life-enhancing,—time, place, circumstance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and the ductless glands alter the assumed value of
any such hypothesis. Hence “good” has been here
defined simply in terms of what the organism is doing,
and not in terms of any spurious teleological
principle. Empirical science has no books to balance.
He who watches a little closely will see that
as far as conduct reveals it (which is, indeed, very
far), all sorts of things that are not particularly life-enhancing
are chosen hourly as the “highest goods”
in the sense of being greedily and furiously pursued.
Sexual excitement, drug-taking, gourmandizing,
idling, and the latest styles in clothing vie with any
and all of these soberer values for first place in the
attention of numberless people. And while many
a man may choose for himself, yet none can choose
for all.</p>

<p>Class B includes skilful and kind persons as objects
to which the term “good” is customarily applied.
No new difficulties confront our attempt to
pronounce the physiological implications of our concept
as thus employed, even if we are obliged to alter
to some slight extent our previous point of view.
The skilful man is called “good” simply because he
does or can mobilize his energy to produce something
which is regarded as useful, fit, or serviceable. Likewise,
the skilful or kind person is one who may be
counted on to assist in maintaining, restoring, or increasing
any state of things that is regarded as desirable.
And we who employ the concept “good”
to praise or encourage such a man insinuate that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
same mobilization of energy is going on within us.
Indeed, as could be readily shown, all perceptions of
persons involve an imitative or empathic response.
That is why skill and virtuosity of all sorts are agreeable
to behold. They furnish numerous outlets for
subconscious action-tendencies.</p>

<p>As regards Class C, the concept “good” points to
“that which fulfils expectation,” that is, the <em>normal</em>
or <em>typical</em> thing. These words “normal” and “typical”
(“implying the existence of characteristic qualities”)
are related to the word “good” by means of
the conditioned reflex. Our experience with all
such things as motor-cars, for example, involves not
only cognition, but eventually discrimination and
comparison as well. Thereafter, when we hear of a
<em>good</em> motor-car, we think of such a one as we have
been trained to regard as capable of a certain kind
of performance. The same thing holds with respect
to all other objects and persons concerning
whom we have become discriminative. “Good,”
thus employed, seems to imply that energy is being
mobilized to perform selective activity, and also
that the sense organs have become specially attuned
to receive a specific stimulus. The “good” cat is
not any old beast of the back alley, but a mouser
with a certain number of catches to her credit. The
“good” grocer (that is, supposedly <em>normal</em>) is one
who gives full weight and makes prompt deliveries.
Moreover, there is implicit in all such uses of this
value predicate some reference to that dependability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
which was discussed in connection with Class B.
Here, then, we may state that Class C implies <em>the
mobilization of energy for the performance of such
action as will maintain our physical or mental equilibrium</em>.
And this, physiologically speaking, is ultimately
a matter of the progressive coordination of
reflexes and the maintenance of muscular tone.</p>

<p>The objects referred to by class D are those which
greatly or even suddenly exceed expectation, whence,
as has been hinted before, the signification of our
concept frequently approaches that of an expletive.
Let us see what physiological mechanisms provide
this shade of meaning. It is generally realized that
not only do our successes and failures, our disappointments
and satisfactions attune our neuro-muscular
mechanism to respond to the typical or normal
thing by calling it “good,” but these same successes
and failures may also whet our appetite for
things which, by exceeding the average, shall make
up for those experiences which have been especially
disappointing. All normal protoplasm is insatiable
for the maximum success. And hunger of any sort,
physiologically speaking, may be described as a condition
in which the motor mechanism is activated to
greater efforts than usual in order to relieve the condition
of want. Consequently, the physiological
implications of the concept “good” may be made as
precise with respect to Class D as with any of the
preceding classes. The action-patterns implied by
this class are those which are exhibited by anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
when, after long privation, the tensions he has accumulated
are suddenly relieved by the appearance
of the desired stimulus. Indeed, such action-patterns
may sometimes be described as rapacity, as
is illustrated in the case of our crying out “Good!”
when some misfortune has befallen a particularly
annoying prig.</p>

<p>The physiological implications of the term “good”
as regards Class E have already been sufficiently
hinted in our delineation of that class. Moreover,
the surprise, shock, and spasm which it connotes prevent
its having an important rôle to play in our
judgments of value.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up and condense these several
points. From the foregoing it appears that he who
uses the word “good” is at the same time exhibiting
a certain specific motor attitude toward the environment
which gives this word its meaning. As we
have already shown, the action-pattern involves the
following physiological conditions:—(1) the presence,
maintenance, or even heightening of muscular
tone, (2) the permeability of the synaptic membranes,
especially of those along the motor pathways,
(3) selective activity and selective excitability,
and (4) normally, the nice coordination of the
motor responses involved in overt action. This
positively responsive condition of the organism may
now be expressed in simpler words by saying that
the word “good” is the sign of an <em>outgoing reaction</em>.
That is to say, in the first place, the things we call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
“good” release the energy that is ready to be discharged;
in the second place, we participate more
fully in that environment which contains a “good”
than in one that does not; and in the third place,
the effect of the presence of continuously “good”
stimuli is to render us more and more responsive, and
to provide a wide margin of resiliency for our organic
interior.</p>

<p>Our definition of good in physiological terms has
now been achieved.</p>

THE ACTION-PATTERNS IMPLIED BY

<span class="smcap">R. W. Sellars</span>, “The Next Step in Religion,” pp. 153-5.<br>
</p>
</div>


<p>Good and bad, or good and evil, have from the
most ancient times been held to be diametrical and
thoroughgoing opposites of each other. In the system
of Zoroaster this antithesis is metaphorically
projected into the remotest heavens, where Mazda,
the God of Light, whose deeds were goodness itself,
endlessly strove to annihilate Angra, the tireless perpetrator
of deceit. The Christian mythologists, in
a characteristic imitation of pagan creeds, loved to
imagine a final Day of Judgment, when the mild,
spotless followers of the Lamb were to be rewarded
by an eternal separation from the sooty henchmen of
Satan. Similar conceptions, though none of them
nearly so poetic, have tinged the thought of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
subsequent era. Most of us are familiar with Milton’s
fabulous version of the theology of the Middle
Ages, in which God the Father is depicted as struggling
against the powers of darkness, not, however,
by sending irresistible cohorts to besiege and conquer
Hell, but rather by counteracting their insidious
propaganda in the playground of Adam’s Eden. Indeed,
one has but to learn to read the simplest literature
in any language to realize how much of what is
called thinking consists simply in devising contrasts
and antitheses. It is the orator’s chief <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de
force</i>, the historian’s commonplace, the dramatist’s
all-important method of producing a plot, and, in
fact, without it, no literature would seem to give an
adequate picture of the realities of human life.
Small wonder then, that in the philosophy of Empedocles,
the world-view of Zoroaster, and the theology
of Christendom, this stereotyped way of thinking,
originating in and generated by the physics and
physiology of man’s musculature, should be manifest;
or that the common man should so readily and
persistently hold to the diametrical opposition between
good and bad, and right and wrong. The
law of reciprocal innervation, being implicit in the
body’s architecture, is necessarily a basic formula
for man’s thought.</p>

<p>Even though this be admitted, it guides us only
a little ways through the tangle of ethical problems.
In the first place, no such dramatic portrayal as, for
example, that of Zoroaster,—whatever theatrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
agonies it might provoke,—has either reduced the
sum of the world’s distresses, or furnished the least
insight into the nature of the supposed opposites of
goodness. For that matter, indeed, very little
knowledge of this character has arisen out of ethical
debate or speculation. The assumptions have been
many, the facts few; and usually, whenever this discrepancy
has been realized, overdrafts have been
written on the phantom bank of theory with the vain
hope that by this means ethical solvency could be
attained. In the second place, it has scarcely occurred
to any one to ask whether there was not some
other way of looking at the ethical problem than in
this duplex manner, for if an irreconcilable opposition
in the field of ethics is assumed as a fundamental
principle, nothing but an eternal deadlock can result
in the conclusion. Now the empirical fact is that
man’s muscles (the functions of which determine his
thoughts), can do other things than oppose and
counteract each other, for every day of our lives we
see these other motor activities manifested. However,
our traditional ethical theory would have it
that the dilemma is inescapable,—that things are
either good or bad, or actions either right or wrong,
and people either virtuous or vicious, and that there
is no middle ground, or possibility of reconciliation.
Mark, however, that only in serious pathological
cases do we observe a complete rigidity of the body
due to chronic muscular antagonisms. Is it not
therefore a valid inference that the mental rigidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of most adherents to the bi-polar theory in ethics is
likewise a pathological sign, and, if so, are we not
driven to the conclusion that man’s traditional ethical
notions are symptoms of physiological malfunctioning?</p>

<p>Important as all this is, however, it cannot turn
us aside from our interest in finding out just to what
an extent the word “bad” is a real antonym to the
word “good,” especially since knowledge of this sort
is first necessary before we can employ the method of
science in the service of the problems of human conduct.
Let us, then, resume our original search.</p>

<p>The term “bad” is a gestural sign which we employ
in two different senses,—to point out a deficiency
or lack, (that is, to indicate merely the <em>absence
of</em> good), and in a positive sense, to hint the
presence of something definitely <em>antagonistic to</em>
good. By an analogy, if money is a good, we should
call it “bad” in the privative sense of the term for
one to be without it; while it is “bad” in the positive
sense for one to be deeply in debt. But even while
we ponder these two behavior situations, they tend,
at least partly, to coalesce, very much indeed as
Classes A and B of “good” merged at times imperceptibly
into one another. For if the man who is
without money, but not in debt, passionately desires
to purchase and spend, he will immediately place
himself in the class of debtors, and experience therewith
the positive form of “badness,” at least so far
as his feelings of inhibition are concerned. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
just to what an extent these two categories of
“bad” may be identified cannot be shown until we
have first reviewed the separate uses to which this
term is put,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and have also deduced the action-patterns
which it implies.</p>

<p>It can be divined at once from a careful perusal of
this brief array, herewith subjoined, that the concept
“bad” is, on the whole, a far less variegated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
symbol than is the concept “good.” Its use is more
restricted, its connotation is less rich in variety, and,
as can be already predicted, the number of separate
classes into which our array may be distributed is
fewer than was the case with the term “good.” For
while we have here hints of three classes which are,
roughly speaking, negatives of Classes A, B, and C
of “good,” we have nothing at all comparable to the
negatives of Classes D and E. To wit:—</p>

<p>Class A. That which is useless, unfit, unserviceable,
and the like, for any purpose whatever.</p>

<p>Class B. That which brings pain, discomfort, loss,
or death. In some respects this class is the negative
of Class B of “good,” having the general meaning
of <em>undependable</em>. However, it is not the negative
of every shade of meaning implied by that
class, as can at once be seen when we consider that
there are no “bads” which are the antitheses of
goods, that is, property. For, as we have already
observed, even some debts are <em>good</em> debts.</p>

<p>Class C. That which disappoints expectation.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Here also the negation is limited, for while with
Class C of “good” the tone of the voice could convey
an immense variety of meanings, here no such
great array of nuances is found.</p>

<p>In consideration, then, of what has just preceded,
we may emphatically deny that “bad” is a true antonym
of the word “good.” Not only is this to be
instantly deduced from the array of uses to which
these terms are put, but also from the contents of
the five classes of “good” and the three classes of
“bad.” We shall presently discover whether
“evil,” as an adjunct of the concept “bad,” makes up
this discrepancy.</p>

<p>Resuming, then, our main theme, how shall we
proceed to define privative and positive “bad” in
physiological terms, and by what means shall we discover
the action-patterns which are implied by the
three classes of “bad” which we have just delimited?</p>

<p>In general, and from the reader’s own experience,
“bad” means thwarting, inhibition, opposition, the
interruption of action, the durable dissatisfactions of
life. We need, however, to come at the matter a
little more closely. In the preceding chapter we
saw that when we are ready to act, the stimulus that
elicits the reaction for which we are keyed up is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
called “good.” Employing the methods of inductive
science, with our eye on the behavior possibilities
of the human organism, we find the following
stimulus-response situations adequate to reveal the
origin of the word “bad.”</p>

<p>1. When we are ready to act in some precise manner,
but no stimulus, that is, opportunity, is afforded
for such action, the term “bad” adequately describes
the situation. Here it becomes a gestural sign
which may point either to the environment or to the
organism. It is for this reason that a man in debt,
hungry, and in want is said to be “in a <em>bad</em> way”;
while in his predicament counterfeit money and
tainted food would be unequivocally bad.</p>

<p>2. When we are ready to act, but are prevented
from releasing the energy we have mobilized because
the stimulus is inadequate, and does not call forth
the exact response which we have been preparing to
make, the situation may again be described as “bad.”
“That’s too bad,” we sometimes say of a suit of
clothes which, while adequately keeping out the winter’s
cold, does not quite fit the shoulders.</p>

<p>3. When we are <em>unready</em>, to act in a certain way,
but are summarily called upon to mobilize our energy
for this purpose, the situation is again often described
as “bad.” Unexpected, excess taxes always
produce an emotional situation specifically related
to this value predicate.</p>

<p>4. Any inadequate response, in other words, one
that is faulty, erroneous, and the like, may be called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“bad.” Sometimes, also, the person making such a
response is described by the same term.</p>

<p>From this it appears that the general meaning of
“bad” is within the scope of our discovery. Not
only is this deducible from our previous identification
of this concept with the <em>useless</em>, the <em>independable</em>,
and with <em>that which disappoints</em>, but it is also
plainly foreshadowed by the four behavior situations
we have just described. “Bad” seems to
imply that action, interest, purpose, and the like,
have been thwarted; that the organism has become
a center of inhibitions, and is in discomfort either
because the energy which it has mobilized cannot
be released into action, or because demands for such
release cannot be met. Such a physiological condition
is best described as <em>incoordinate</em>. And this
term covers all three of our classes of “bad.” Moreover,
by partial contrast with <em>good</em>, “bad” implies a
<em>withdrawing reaction</em>, with either a slump in muscular
tone (in which case we have <em>privative</em> “bad”),
or else a sudden onset of unrelieved tensions—(<em>positive</em>
“bad”). Accompanying such a condition,
we may safely postulate synaptic impermeability
and inhibition, together with varying degrees of unpleasant
strain sensations. But mark, that we do
not say that the “bad” is always equivalent to the
painful.</p>

<p>Were physiological science sufficiently advanced,
it would be possible for us to complete our definition
of badness in terms of the mal-functioning of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
internal systems as the alimentary canal, the cardiac,
respiratory, and excretory mechanisms, and
the endocrine glands. Our common experience indubitably
indicates that all forms of thwarting and
inhibition which prompt our exclamations, react violently
upon the internal machinery. Indeed, it is
not too much to claim that both the centrifugal and
centripetal types of behavior which are implied by
the terms “good” and “bad” respectively just as
often as not have their source in the postures and
manœuvres of our organic interior. That is, brief
to say, why the healthy man and the dyspeptic, the
optimist and the pessimist, will give precisely opposite
accounts of the same external world. We remarked
before that speech not only points out and
distinguishes objects for us, but also implies and predicts
human activities. Our analysis of good and
bad fortifies this thesis beyond contradiction, and
shows that any value predicate that has a specific
reference to the environment has specific implications
for the organism as well.</p>


<h3><em>The Physiology of “Evil”</em></h3>

<p>In some minds the term “evil” has primarily
what is called a <em>moral</em> signification, and implies first
and foremost anything “contrary to an accepted
standard of righteousness,” or anything “inconsistent
with or violating the moral law”; and consequently,
it is equivalent to the terms “sinful” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
“wicked.” Let us not meet such minds too intimately.
Speaking in this fashion is not only vague,
but misleading as well. For when duly examined,
almost every so-called “standard of righteousness”
becomes a totally unspecific category of behavior,
while the term “moral law” is not <em>law</em> in any dependable
sense of the term at all. Certainly it is
not a law of nature,—of human nature,—for it does
not adequately describe any typical behavior situations.
Neither is it law to a jurist, since there is no
organized force that can be brought to bear upon
human beings to compel them to obey it in their actions,
much less in their thinking. Moreover, the
terms “sinful” and “wicked” are so narrow and provincial
and so exclusively employed by religionists
“to pelt their adversaries with,” that their equivalence
to “evil” as a term of value in the broadest
ethical sense is, to say the least of it, problematical.
Whether unfortunately or not, none of the purely
<em>moral</em> categories are fundamental for an understanding
of the actual behavior of human beings. Indeed,
as a usual thing, they hint uncritical and disorderly
thinking in him who uses them, rather than
specify any intelligent and sympathetic appreciation
of human interests, or any analytical insight into the
environment which now thwarts and now furthers
such interests.</p>

<p>And now to our analysis. The term “evil” is
much more assertive than is the word “bad,” and
more forceful than all but a few significations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
word “good.” It originally had the adverbial force
of <em>up</em> or <em>over</em>, two words whose empathic significance
is worthy of remark. Today the term “evil” signifies
either (a) “that which exceeds due measure,” or
(b) “that which oversteps proper limits.” Here,
then, we notice at the outset that “evil,” unlike either
good or bad, always carries with it the presumption
of standards or rules.</p>

<p>To a large extent the place in the language formerly
occupied by the term “evil” is now held by the
term “bad.” With the reasons for this change we
are not especially concerned here, although it may be
appropriate to point out that the popularity of any
term that has been used almost exclusively by religionists
for purposes of anathema is doomed. Besides,
the word “evil” calls up literary associations
which condemn it to modern minds. Such expressions
as “The Evil One” (that is, the Devil of the
Middle Ages), the “evil eye” (another outworn
superstition), the “King’s Evil,” and a dozen other
equally obsolete terms have fallen into such low repute
that they have weakened, so to speak, the gestural
significance of the remnants of this concept.
Nevertheless, it must be admitted that there is far
more dramatic vocal quality attaching to the term
“evil” than to either of the words “good” or “bad.”
Few words in the language provide such an opportunity
as does this one for the simultaneous display
of eye-, lip-, and jaw-gestures, whose combined effects
are none the less striking, no matter how empathically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
unpleasant they have become. We invite
you to stand before the mirror, and say the
word “evil” with clenched teeth and canines showing,
and verify this remark.</p>

<p>While the term “evil” is employed as an adjective,
a noun, and an adverb, we do not need to stop here
to catalogue its uses under these three headings.
All we need to consider is that “evil” is an intensification
of “bad” in the positive sense of that
term.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is also a forceful negative of Class B of
good, in the sense that it implies <em>that which actively
operates to produce incoordination, mal-adjustment,
discomfort, and the like</em>. It will be recalled that
Class B of “good” included whatever conduced to
life, health, pleasure, and stability. On the contrary,
“evil” is a gestural sign that indicates any and
all processes of disintegration, disruption, and confusion.
It at once implies something which is energetically
antagonistic to our purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>The definition of evil in mechanistic terms is now
within our reach. We have said before that “evil”
is an intensification of the term “bad,” which latter
term was used to describe an incoordinate condition
of the organism brought about because its wishes,
interests, and purposes,—in a word, its action-patterns,—had
been thwarted. Just what more
than this does “evil” imply? <em>It implies that our
wishes have been thwarted to such an extent as to
call forth from us the most energetic, antagonistic
reactions of which we are capable.</em> “Good” signifies
an outgoing reaction, “bad” signifies a withdrawing
reaction, while “evil” means that within the organism
some of the available energies are being hastily
mobilized to compensate for an outgoing reaction
that has been thwarted. Of course, there are many
persons who never attempt any compensation of such
a constructive character as to prevent the recurrence
of the same evil situation, either because they are
physically unfit, or are poor in spirit, but in such
cases the word “evil” is used without very much
meaning.</p>

<p>Our definition of this concept will, I think, serve to
provide a new interpretation of the statement made
previously, namely, that “evil always carries with it
the presumption of standards or rules.” What, precisely,
does this statement mean? It means that
whenever we have lost our organic equilibrium in the
presence of a situation described as <em>evil</em>, whatever
we do to recover it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> at that moment defines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
not only the standard and rule by which our
conduct is regulated, but such behavior also reveals
to others just what the “problem of evil” really
means to us. For example, if we are vexed and become
profane, profanity is patently an integral factor
in our philosophy of compensation. If we lose
our money, and steal another’s to make good our
loss, theft is a cardinal principle in our doctrine of
equalization. We may, to be sure, immediately
thereafter lament the outburst by which we attempted
to “set things to rights,” but we cannot retrieve
the action by which we defined and exhibited
our practical ethical philosophy. Our recent Emerson
had this scientific truth in mind when he said,
“What you are speaks so loud, I cannot hear what
you say.” Examples of another sort are equally
illuminating. If Socrates is condemned to death for
corrupting the Athenian youth, and calmly drinks
the hemlock in order to remain a law-abiding citizen
to the end, this deed of probity defines the dominant
action-pattern in his philosophy of retaliation. If
Jesus is crucified for blasphemy and inciting to insurrection,
and manifests an attitude of non-resistance
and equanimity, these action-patterns once
more exhibit his method of dealing with the problem
of evil. In every such case the bodily habits which
have long accumulated are automatically released by
the appropriate stimulus into overt behavior. In
physiological terms, what a man does in response to
evil, shows what sort of reciprocal innervations his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
body has acquired. And while such a mechanistic
interpretation of an ethical standard may seem astonishing,
yet such a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus agendi</i> is, unless we are
greatly deceived, the one which human beings
actually employ, and consequently it is the only
one which has any place in an empirical science of
conduct.</p>


<h3><em>A Further Remark on the Opposites of “Good”</em></h3>

<p>From our definition of “evil” as an intensification
of “bad” in the positive sense of that term, it can at
once be noted that these two words do not even together
supply a thoroughgoing antonym to the word
“good.” For they do not strictly imply action-patterns
which in the minute and fine are opposed to
those underlying all the valid uses of the word
“good.” It is not to the point that “in general”
(which can only mean here <em>vaguely</em>) these words
are antithetical to each other; our analysis has produced
knowledge that henceforth discounts all such
remarks. And, if anyone says that for the purposes
of morality, the traditional antithesis is still
valid, the answer is that morality, after all, is only
custom, while ethics is primarily a critical insight
into that reality which the moralist has always
sought to make obscure.</p>

<p>A more important conclusion, however, is still to
be drawn from the foregoing analysis. Which is,
that “evil” is not, as has usually been concluded, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
opposite of “good.” Indeed, if we have described
the situation fairly, when we say that ‘evil denotes
that our wishes have been thwarted to such an extent
as to call forth from us the most energetic,
antagonistic reactions of which we are capable,’ we
can only deduce from this that the antagonistic reactions
are aroused for the purpose of replacing
something that is “bad” by something that is
“good.” But if this be the case, then the emphatic
quality attaching to the word “evil” is really a sign
that we have already started an outgoing reaction
that shall furnish the desired compensation. This
two-fold meaning of the word “evil” is worthy of
more than a passing remark, but suffice it to say
that in the light of what has gone before, the “problem
of evil” now becomes the problem of educating
a man how to replace the “bad” with the “good,”
rather than a problem over which the metaphysician
may dawdle or the moralist mope.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> In passing, it might be pertinent to consider the question as to
whether the word “bad” <em>is</em> synonymous with ‘that which disappoints
expectation.’ One might ask, for example, “Do not chronic pessimists
literally expect catastrophe?” Here, as elsewhere, we must
not be deceived by a trick of speech. For he who says, “I expect
disaster,” is unwittingly making an equivocal statement. The man
who makes such a remark cannot be implying that his whole body,
with its numerous action-patterns, is completely set to receive the
stimulus that will demolish his equilibrium. Rather should we
infer from this utterance that he is at least partly prepared to resist
it, partly to rejoice at the incident discomfiture to others, with
the hope thereby of making his own troubles dwindle by comparison,
and perhaps also partly anticipating the relief that will come when
the suspense of waiting is over. None of these interpretations
disallow the formulation of any of the above classes of “bad.” To
be sure, there are certain abnormal types, like the sadist and the
masochist, to whom pain is an erotic stimulus, but even so, their
expectations are always directed to that particular element of the
situation which, by affording an outgoing reaction, is for them a
“good.”</p>

<p>“From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous
character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising.
Why, from Plato and Aristotle downwards,
philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of
the knowledge of the particular, and in adoration of that of
the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable
knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things,
and that the <em>things</em> of worth are all concretes and singulars.
The only value of universal characters is that they
help us, by reasoning, to know new truths about individual
things.... In sum, therefore, the traditional universal-worship

<p>There had been a murder in the Maritime Provinces,
and two men, a jurist and a layman, were discussing
it. The murdered man, it appeared, had
from time to time missed some of his sheep, and
one day, upon hearing a shot fired, ran down into
his pasture, and came upon two boys, one of whom
was carrying a gun, and the other a bag whose contours
plainly revealed that it contained the body of
a sheep. The farmer ordered the boys to follow
him to town to give an account of their misbehavior;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and this they proceeded to do without any show of
resistance or word of objection. But suddenly, and
without any warning, the boy who carried the gun
shot the farmer in the back of the head, killing him
instantly. The murderer was later apprehended,
and put into the county jail, awaiting trial.</p>

<p>“And would they hang a boy of seventeen in
Canada?” asked the layman.</p>

<p>“Why not?” enquired the jurist, “They can hang
anyone here who has reached the age of discretion,
and who knows the difference between right and
wrong.”</p>

<p>“And will you tell me,” parried the layman,
“just what that age is, and exactly what that difference
is?”</p>

<p>The jurist eyed his inquisitor for a moment, and
burst into a laugh. “Only a fool would ask such a
question!” he retorted, and turned away.</p>

<p>All of which goes to show that a man may be proficient
in legal technique, and yet be an ignoramus in
ethics. Knowledge of the meaning of the word
“right” is both possible and profitable, and it is
hardly too much to suppose that such knowledge,
when disseminated, might even produce a salutary
effect upon legal theory and legal practice.</p>

<p>Anyone who endeavors to marshal the array of
all the uses to which the word “right” is put, will
be astonished to find out how extensive the list is.
In point of the richness of its denotation and connotation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
this concept exceeds the term “good.”
And while it resembles that word in being used as
a noun, a verb, an adjective, and an adverb, it significantly
differs from the term “good” in that it is
employed to refer principally to the relations and
functions of things, and hardly ever to objects of
the physical environment.</p>

<p>No man’s span of perception is large enough, or
his span of attention long enough, to surround the
complete array of the uses of the word “right” unless
this array be divided into classes. Such division
will presently appear. And I think it can be
shown that no matter how little in common some of
the terms of this array seem, to a casual observer, to
possess, when they are thus grouped into classes,
they will be subtly linked together by adequate
bonds. Let us then introduce:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class A</span></h3>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>The Word “Right” as a Term that is Descriptive of

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>The original signification of our concept was
<em>straight</em>, a word, be it noted, that is usually defined
in the negative. (See Ex. 1, p. 76.) Why we
have a negative definition for a word that seems to
have a positive meaning, especially to mathematicians
and draughtsmen, is not at first quite obvious.
However, when this phenomenon is duly examined
from the point of view of the mechanics of man’s
locomotor apparatus, its secret is no longer hidden.
All of the movements naturally produced by the appendages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of the body are curvilinear: the arm being
a lever, or radius vector, it always draws arcs in
space or on paper; so does the hand as a whole, and
so do the fingers. “Right” signifying <em>straight</em>,
therefore, is defined negatively simply because
straight lines are alien to the physics and mechanics
of man’s original nature.</p>

<p>Where, then, did man get the notion of straightness,
and what has this first class of the uses of
“right” to do with ethics? Man got the notion of
straightness, we surmise, from such things as freely
falling bodies, which give not only the idea of perpendicular,
but also and at the same time the ideas
of <em>direct</em> and <em>immediately</em>; from the sunbeams which
drew for him imaginary lines among the clouds and
through the foliage of the forest; from his need of
taking the shortest course across the fields in pursuit
of wild animals for the supply of his larder;
and from his reminiscent ponderings of the comparative
merits of less and less curved and crooked arrows
used in the chase. Moreover, man walks with
the greatest safety and pursues his game with the
greatest chances of success when his feet go without
hesitation on a level or straight surface. Under
these conditions he can attain his ends directly and
immediately; as the saying is, “Things will then
come out all <em>right</em>.” Consequently, even the straight
line has ethical implications: the speed with which
some actions are performed and the time required to
cover the distance between man and his objective are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
very often the chief considerations in the attainment
of a good or the avoidance of an evil thing.</p>

<p>And this brings us by a very slight transition to</p>


<h3>Class B</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>“Right” as Descriptive of the Method (or
Object) by Which the Desired End Can be
Obtained.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Here the purpose involved, or the end sought, is
neither praised nor blamed. Nor have we indeed
as yet reached any basis by which a criterion of purposes
and ends can be established. So far as we
have gone, “right” implies technique, and nothing
more.</p>

<p class="fs90">The members of this class are as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot fs90">


<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">13. The “right” information.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">14. “Right” whale; the one to capture in order to get whalebone.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">15. “Rub your sarsnet well, the <em>right</em> way of the sarsnet.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">16. “Let it be a constant rule to scrub the boards the <em>right</em>
way of the grain, that is, lengthwise.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">17. “The ship ceased rolling and <em>righted</em> herself.” (Compare
this signification with <em>perpendicular</em>, previously
given.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">18. “Stand it <em>upright</em>, or it will fall.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">19. “Whose inhabitants were <em>right</em> shooters (at an haires
breadth and faile not).”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">20. “Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,
And be a boy <em>right</em> out.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">21. “I am <em>right</em> of mine old master’s humour for that.”</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class C</span></h3>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>“Right” as Descriptive of any Statement Which
Reports the Facts; of any Opinion or Judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
that is Correct; and of any Person Who
Judges, Thinks, or Acts in Accordance with
the Facts or the Truth about a Matter.</em><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that the significations in this
class are all symptomatic of a slight change in the
meaning of the concept “right.” The emphasis here
is upon true opinions and judgments in contrast to
false ones. Moreover, the range of behavior covered
by Class C is somewhat broader than that denoted
by the two preceding classes. He who now uses
this word “right” becomes judicial, and makes statements
he is willing to defend. More than this we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
cannot say. We assume many a time, no doubt, that
the statements we call true are backed by something
not ourselves; and while in some cases nature’s laws
are in a sense “behind” our statements, yet unless
this is the case, there is nothing whatever to fall
back upon. Thus, while a man may demonstrate
that dynamite is, as he says, truly explosive, yet
in cases of the equitable adjustment of social frictions,
where both parties pour out a tumult of exaggerations,
no similar truth of opinion is obtainable.
It would therefore be illogical to assume that we
have reached any absolute criterion in passing from
Class B to Class C of “right.” He who uses this
concept in this connection has, indeed, ventured more
than he who uses it only to imply the preceding two
classes, but he is not thereby gifted with superior
powers of discretion. All we can say is that he who
undertakes to make a judgment with all the available
information before him is more likely to be
chosen as a referee again. He will at least have
the satisfaction of knowing that if he makes mistakes,
they will probably be some that he has never
made before. And this way much of human progress
lies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class D</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>“Right” as the Distinctive Epithet of the Hand

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>The use of our concept in this connection is
firmly bound to its use in the preceding classes.
For it is no accident that in the mechanistic process
called evolution human aims and purposes have come
to be furthered and achieved principally through the
power and skill of the arm and hand. The “right”
arm and hand point reasonably <em>straight</em>, throw missiles
in a fairly direct <em>manner</em>, and their powerful
shots bring down the quarry <em>immediately</em>. (Class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
A.) These parts of the body are also among the
most educible and skilful in the technique requisite
for bringing about a desired end. Their action-patterns
are indeed often the very method by which
ambitions are achieved. (Class B.) And when
we have reached a judgment that is deemed to be
true or in accordance with the facts of the matter
(Class C.), it is our “right” hand that is ready to be
motivated in its defence. Even the art of writing,
in the original sense of cutting, tearing, or scratching
to produce a record or a design, is not at all distantly
related to the functions of this part of the body.</p>

<p>With this clearly understood, the transition is
easy to make to</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class E</span></h3>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><em>Legal “Rights”; that is, Those Claims and Interests
the Establishment and Protection of Which
May Be Secured by Force and even Violence.</em><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As used in this connection, “right” is partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
equivalent to <em>might</em>, since our concept here connotes
an organized force,—a physical power,—which, under
given conditions, can be employed for the purpose
of establishing claims and protecting interests.
This organized force is popularly referred to as
“the Law,” especially by those who indulge in
back-yard altercations and cry out: “If you do that
again, I’ll have the Law on you!” And the ordinary
man, whose six or seven years of public schooling
have implanted in him the fixed habit of reifying
all abstractions, understands the law as equivalent to
a transcendental force of some kind which makes his
threats effective. As befits the mental calibre of
such a man, the law frequently becomes synonymous
with the functions of the police, who are naïvely supposed
to know when and how to protect everybody’s
legal rights. This is an error. Not only are the
police extremely ignorant persons, but they have
scarcely any legal status whatever. They are “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
tolerated remnant of the autocratic power which
absolute monarchs once exercised over their subjects.”
Law and legal rights are functions of the
courts, while the police are simply unattached
huskies hired to bring into court those who do not
come there of their own initiative. We must look
elsewhere for the source of the might which legal
rights are said and felt to possess, namely, in the
origin and function of law itself.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, law originated as a means to protect
men against loss of property, against bodily
harm, and against damage to their personality
through the actions of their fellows. It did not
originate as a means to prevent or repair the damage
to life or property caused by cloudbursts or lightning,
or the loss of income brought about by avalanches,
laziness, or disease; it had only to do with
actions for which some man could be held responsible.
Now the actions which produce the loss of
property, bodily harm, and damage to personality
are usually actions arising from, as well as leading
to, emotional disturbances. Theft, murder, and
libel, for example, are about the most potent stimuli
to violent retaliation that can be provided. Nevertheless,
it is sound psychology that most emotions
quickly cool if the stimulus be withdrawn, that wrath
has to be nursed if it is to be kept warm, and that
absence does not make the heart grow fonder.
Here is where the law performs its chief function.
For the law is simply an ingenious device to get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
judgment on the conflict of human interests which
shall not be tinged with the passions that provoked
the conflict. And while legal procedure may not always
be fair, especially in the eyes of the loser, its
methods certify that it shall not be precipitous or
rancorous in rendering a decision. Legal rights,
therefore, are not equivalent to the capacity for revenge,
but rather consist in the ability to get old
quarrels looked at by new and unbiased eyes.
Herein consists much of the prestige of the law, and
since prestige has always been regarded as a kind of
power, men are not slow to employ it in the establishment
of their claims and the protection of their
interests.</p>

<p>Law, however, is frequently misinterpreted when
its function is thought to be preventative of discord,
rather than judicial and equitable. Law is no guardian
angel. No law can prevent the unobserved
Richard Roe from murdering the defenceless John
Doe; nor can it hinder the murderer (still unobserved)
from altering Doe’s will to his own material
advantage; neither can it be guaranteed to
forestall the murderer from making the false plea
that Doe was about to assault his daughter. The
law did not make man in its own image; according
to scripture it was God who did that. Law does
not set out to protect the careless or the poor in
spirit. Its machinery is normally put into operation
only for those with enough initiative to look out
for their own interests. If a patentee knowingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
allows one infringement of his patent rights, he
might as well donate his invention to the public.
The law does not hunt for trouble, or carry on a
bureau for the exchange of expressions of malcontent.
It does not even demand that a clearly known
offender of society, and one conscious of his offence,
enter a plea of guilty. Actually, the function
of law is simply to preserve and to restore order
and peace in society, and not to define what that
order and peace shall be. Were ninety per cent of
the people in the world suddenly to become stubbornly
devoted to thieving, the public peace would
have to be redefined in terms of their attitude toward
property. Moreover, as it is now, the law
merely attempts to imitate the security which is provided
by “gentlemen’s agreements,” which security
is largely maintained without the help of the courts.
For it is very plain that millions keep the peace,
while only a few hundreds know the law. Law,
then, may be fairly characterized as an impersonal
referee, whose business it is to persuade and oblige
the disturbers of the social equilibrium to employ
the methods and standards of conduct which have
always marked free men.</p>

<p>With this by way of introduction, it is not difficult
to understand why “right” in the legal sense of
the word is so closely related to <em>might</em>. For the
term “legal rights” refers not only to those claims
and interests which may be established and protected,
but also and rather to those which <em>have long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
been</em> secured by force. In other words, some of
them have the advantage of the momentum of custom
and tradition. Now custom and tradition,
whatever else they may be, are certainly action-patterns
which are generated and maintained by the
bodies of human beings. They are habits, both of
overt action and covert thought,—response processes
of the neuro-muscular apparatus. The tenacity
of these habits, moreover, is due to the combined
action of two well-known physiological mechanisms,—the
conditioned reflex and the circular reflex.
The conditioned reflex, which is dependent upon the
repetition of stimuli, is particularly prevalent where
day by day the same persons, the same kinds of property,
and the same predicaments of living are met
with; and so we may say that customs and traditions
(and with them the inevitable claims and interests)
are created by the environment as much as by the
organism. The circular reflex, or proprio-ceptive
reinforcement of any action-tendency, governs much
of our behavior, even though we little suspect it.
It underlies occupational postures, idiosyncracies of
gait and of facial expression, and indeed, without circular
reflexes we should not have either tenacity of
purpose or the ability to hold a grudge. Its function
in the establishment and maintenance of those
action-patterns on which tradition depends is of
paramount importance. And since these two reflexes
are largely responsible for the difficulty with
which habits of action and thought are broken, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
support which they give to maintaining the tradition
of legal rights is hardly to be overestimated. Thus,
from the mechanistic point of view, the homage
which we give to legal rights is after all simply
equivalent to the expenditure of energy in our bodies
for the purpose of maintaining particular habits of
action. Indeed, in those who maintain the public
peace, all the energy which goes into actions which
promote the order of society is literally spent to uphold
legal rights of one sort or another. It is this
energy, this physical power, which we referred to
recently when we said that “right” is partially
equivalent to <em>might</em>.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of the apparently great amount
of muscle power that is, so to speak, behind all legal
rights, from the logical point of view, the use and
effectiveness of this power is altogether contingent
upon the exact nature of the claim and interest which
one desires to be secured. The logical statement of
the situation here involved would take the form of
a hypothetical proposition, namely, <em>If</em> the claim or
interest is of a certain kind, <em>then and then only</em> may
it be established and protected. And while this
might seem at first to indicate that legal rights were
seriously lacking in point of authority, yet this is not
the case, for the strongest possible assertions that
can be made are always couched in the form of hypothetical
propositions. As Couterat states in his
“Algebra of Logic,” “Every proposition which implies
another is stronger than the latter, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
latter is weaker than the one which implies it.”
The blunt categorical proposition is far less powerful,
since by itself it implies nothing whatever,
whereas hypotheticals leave no doubt as to the
necessary consequences. All the laws of nature,
which, by the way, cannot be broken, are stated
in hypothetical form. Moreover, since it is the
antecedent, and not the consequent, of a hypothetical
proposition which gives it strength, it is easy to
see that any particular claim and interest is rendered
all the more likely of being established and protected
<em>if</em> similar claims and interests have long been recognized
in the law as valid. In practice we find this
to be the case: the common law which is the oldest
code is also the one to which new claims to legal
right are invariably referred.</p>

<p>Having looked at the picture of legal rights from
one angle, let us now look at it from another.
While in strict logic the statement of these rights in
the form of a hypothetical imperative gives them an
undeniable strength, it must now be admitted that
from the pragmatic point of view it signifies at times
a discouraging weakness. For it has often been the
case that the establishment of claims and the protection
of interests has in practice depended upon such
vexatious variables as the pet theories of experts
(e. g., alienists), the hunger, fatigue, and stubbornness
of jurymen, the internal secretions of judges, a
crowded or empty condition of the jails, current
sociological theory, and even such astonishing things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
as one’s affiliation with secret societies, or one’s political
“pulls,” not to mention, except by a passing remark,
the determination of a litigant to carry his
case to the higher courts clear beyond the ability of
his antagonist’s purse to follow him there. So that
if we ask whether some particular claim or interest
can and will be established or protected, the real
answer in a large number of border-line cases is,
“Nobody knows.” Justice, who carries in her hand
a balance whereby to weigh the evidence fairly, has
also her eyes blindfolded against seeing what manner
of weights are put into either pan. This defect of
law, however, is not to be wondered at when we remember
that legal theory cannot anticipate all of the
innumerable claims and interests which either honest
or knavish persons are likely to support as valid.
If the theory of law had been as complicated as
human society has become, it could not have accomplished
the half of what it has already achieved.</p>

<p>From all this it can be seen that the assertion of a
legal right is not always equivalent to its substantiation.
Times change, bringing with them new faces
and other minds, new problems and new interpretations.
Nor, for that matter, are all commonly accepted
rights under the law equally to be supported
by physical force. Strictly speaking, only those
rights which imply a correlative duty are truly legal
rights. Reciprocity of action is essential. For example,
if Baker has a legally recognized or substantiated
right to do, receive, or enjoy something, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the duty of Atkins and others not to infringe or nullify
that right. Mark also, that both duty and right
here imply that physical force may be directed
against some specified person, or against all persons
generally in case of need, in order to establish the
claim and protect the interest involved. However,
as may be already suspected, not everything that
is legally sanctioned or which enters into legal machinery
has the same force behind it as in the case
we have just cited. The right of ownership, for example,
which to the layman seems to be a unit right,
involves five distinct things, as follows: (1) the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
disponendi</i>, or right to give away, (2) the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus utendi</i>,
or right to use, (3) the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus abutendi</i>, or the right to
abuse, (4) the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus prohibendi</i>, the right to keep others
away, and (5) the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus possidendi</i>, or the right to
recover the property. But only one of these is,
strictly speaking, a right in the sense that it involves
a correlative duty, namely, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus prohibendi</i>. For
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus disponendi</i> is simply a power, and not a right
at all: and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus utendi</i> is wholly negative in the
legal sense, implying non-interference in the exercise
of a natural power; whereas the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus abutendi</i> is a
liberty (neither a right nor a power) whose exercise
is nominally unrestricted: while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus possidendi</i>
is simply the legal capacity to get back that which
one is said to own.</p>

<p>This ends our account of legal rights. We now
pass to the consideration of the other uses of this
most comprehensive ethical concept. Somewhat by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
way of contrast to that which has just preceded, let
us at once consider</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class F</span></h3>

<p class="no-indent">under which are comprised what are popularly
known as “moral” <em>rights</em>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>A casual glance at the appended list of the members
of this class might lead one to consider them
simply as a continuation of legal rights, but this is
by no means the case. Albeit moral rights are identical
with legal rights in so far as they imply a multitude
of human claims and interests, they are nevertheless
emphatically different from them on a much
more important point. Moral rights lack all implications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
of an organized physical force to compel
their recognition. The only compulsions that can
be said to assist in the establishment of the claims
and the protection of the interests comprised under
the scope of moral rights are the approval and disapproval
of the group which undertakes to recognize
and support them. In fine, these compulsions
amount to the force of public opinion. And while
this force is at times provocative of changes in the
method or content of the law which may later be
recognized as good, on the whole, public opinion is
usually so unspecific and inconstant as to be wholly
negligible as a power to enforce any demands. Certainly
no jurist regards moral right as obligatory.</p>

<p>On still another count moral rights show a serious
defect. For when we say that the enforcement
of the claims and interests comprised within
the scope of moral rights depends upon the approval
of the group, it must not be supposed that the actions
of any group and the actions which it approves
are necessarily one and the same. This is a sour
paradox, but its appropriateness cannot be successfully
denied. The standard of conduct which any
group subscribes to under pressure, either in writing,
or before an audience, is singularly different from
the behavior of the group under easier circumstances.
Moreover, it is the exception, and not the
rule, for those who dominate a group,—whether
such masters be parents, political bosses, or any
other form of lordling,—to hold their charges to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
stricter accountability than they themselves, removed
from correlative restraints, recognize as imperative.
Doubtless, in the execution of the law, many
a time privileges are granted to people of wealth
and prestige which are denied to the humbler petitioners
at the bar; but the difference between legal
and moral practice is significantly this: that in legal
practice evasions are no integral part of the machinery.
This does not amount to a condemnation of
moral rights: it is merely holding up the mirror to
man, in order that he may see himself clearly. All
in all, consistency may be as impracticable as it has
been unsought for in the daily affairs of men.</p>

<p>However, when we consider the unusual claims
made in behalf of moral rights, there are valid exceptions
to be taken to them. For while in the strict
legal sense, moral right is impotent, yet according
to the expressed opinion of the untutored majority,
moral right is far mightier than legal right. Let
us see why this is so.</p>

<p>In the first place, not all human claims and interests
are or can be protected by law. It is not the
purpose of law to be rigid. However many statutes,
for example, are enacted year by year, the interests
they are supposed to protect increase too rapidly to
be covered by such statutes. Moreover, as in the
case with the right of ownership, many powers and
privileges are granted, the exact enjoyment or exercise
of which no law could either predict or circumscribe.
Hence there always remains a residue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
interest that is not comprised within the scope of
matured legal tradition. But it is just these newer
interests for which some persons demand most emphatically
the right to be satisfied. We live not in
the past, but on the foremost edge of time, and we
are prone to demand as much support for our youngest
claims as for those which have a thousand years
of legal recognition behind them. Now, undoubtedly,
many claims are insufficiently recognized by
law. When, however, in the pause before this recognition
is secured, people begin to claim for such
interests a “superior” moral right to be satisfied,
and in comparison to that “superior” right assert
that legal rights are merely unfounded prejudices,
the charge of inconsistency can be leveled directly
against them. Ignorance of the function and scope
of the law is no excuse for holding it up to ridicule.
Indeed, it is not at all certain that the law could include
the satisfaction of every human claim and
interest whatever without becoming itself destroyed
by this inclusion.</p>

<p>In the second place, there are some persons in
whom the law’s delays, as well as their experience
with the <em>un</em>evenhandedness of justice, has provoked
a deep-seated prejudice against particular lawyers
and jurists, which prejudice, by means of the fallacy
of composition, they readily transmute into a scorn
for whatever is expressly denominated as legal.
Under such conditions the penchant for moral rights
may be often nothing but the product of a mind that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
has become malcontent with things as they are; with
the result that solace is sought in the fiction of a set
of moral rights which are regarded as possessing a
“higher” or final authority. From such a person
come Examples Nos. 59 and 76, recently cited. Two
comments can be made upon such a case as this.
The first of these is that it is quite certain that no
man who has become so pessimistic will see his way
clear to the solution of the problem that has given
him so much tragic concern. As Spinoza says, “The
will and the intellect are one and the same,” but as
Spinoza also hinted, the intellect and the emotions
are not. Moreover, such malcontentedness is relatively
easy to annul: let anyone who curses the law
begin to make use of it to his advantage, and his
“suppressed complex,” as the Freudians would say,
rapidly evaporates.</p>

<p>A third and final reason why moral rights and the
so-called moral law are sometimes regarded as superior
to all things legal is that among so many persons
the curious conviction obtains that they are
individually the pets of Providence, and that consequently
whether they stir themselves or not, become
sagacious or remain meek as lambs, their affairs will
be satisfactorily adjusted without their exertions.
Under such illusions many persons take refuge
throughout their lives, forgetting curiously enough
that the order of nature has not supplied them with
benevolent guardians, tutors, and managers. The
result is that to such people right is synonymous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
merely with what <em>ought to be</em>, rather than with even
a small part of what already is. But when they
thus employ the term right, it is debased. One
often hears such people say with regard to a catastrophe:
“Oh, well, I suppose we shall have to make
the best of it,”—a remark that is rarely prophetic
of anything more than continued brooding. If it
prophesied the accumulation of technique for a continuous,
constructive effort, their moral rights would
not be so bereft of reality.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class G</span></h3>

<p>Here the word “right” signifies certain unspecified
and unrestricted liberties and privileges sanctioned
in the manner of customs, the only authority
behind which is the threat of social ostracism should
they be disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As will be observed at once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
some of the members of this class might, if one prefers,
be included in some of the other classes of
“right.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class H</span></h3>

<p>That which is most convenient, desirable, or favorable;
conforming to one’s wish or desire; to be
preferred; fortunate; lucky, etc.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Some of these
examples, like those in the preceding class, may in
the eyes of some judges be more appropriately classified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
in another place. If so, let the change be made.
There is undoubtedly an echo of Class B and of
Class F in several instances. But a more important
item seems to be that here are unmistakable hints
of an adverbial or expletive signification for our concept.
This hint is fully carried out in the final
division,</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class I</span></h3>

<p class="no-indent">in which the term “right” signifies “very,” “in a great
degree,” as in certain titles: (111) “<em>Right</em> reverend,”
(112) “<em>Right</em> honorable,” as well as in the expressions:
(113) “<em>Right</em> truly may it be said,” and
(114) “The word ‘cootie’ is <em>right</em> old Scottish.”
However, as this use of the concept <em>right</em> is often
to be interpreted as signifying “justly entitled to
the name of,” or “having the true character of,”
Class I may be regarded as a footnote to Classes C
and G.</p>

<p>This completes our search for the significations of
the word “<em>right</em>.” Nevertheless, all this is merely
a preliminary step toward the main business of our
investigation, namely, the discovery of the action-patterns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
which are implied by these nine classes we
have just delimited. We have seen that these
classes are all subtly connected, and this leads us to
hope that some greatest common denominator will
be found that will factor into all of them. It is
also apparent that as we pass from Class A to Class
E, we reach a climax, after which we decline; that
up to the climax there is order and dignity, and that
from Class F onwards our array consists mostly of
scraps and debris. Our problem, then, is to exhibit
not only the motor attitude which each class
implies, but also the procession of such attitudes
throughout the whole nine classes. For only by so
doing shall we be able to comprehend the meaning
of this important ethical concept.</p>


<h3><em>The Meaning of the Word “Right”</em></h3>

<p>1. As deduced from Class A. It will be recalled
that this class signifies <em>straight</em> (not curved or
crooked in any way), <em>direct</em> (by the shortest course),
and <em>immediately</em> (in the quickest time). These
words, moreover, refer not only to events in nature,
but also and more particularly, to human activities.
It has also been pointed out that when a man can
proceed in a straight line toward his objective, he
will proceed directly, and arrive there in the quickest
possible time. Such behavior is, within the limits
hitherto defined, described as <em>right</em>. Now what
does all this involve in the way of action-patterns?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
It involves, first, perception of the goal, second, ability
to keep the goal in mind, and third, energy sufficient
to attain it. According to Max Meyer, one of
the instincts manifested by a hungry organism is “to
proceed forward in a straight line” (!) And
whether this be truly instinctive or not, the example
illustrates our point very nicely. For any organism
vexed with hunger of any sort whatsoever (and
there are, according to the poets, many kinds), will
do “right” in following Max Meyer’s advice. The
action-pattern implied in all this is not difficult to
determine. It is the coordination of motor activities
requisite for the movement of the whole
body speedily through space, unwaveringly toward
its objective.</p>

<p>The complete analysis of the mechanisms by
which such behavior is accomplished would be both
too difficult and too exhaustive to be undertaken
here. We may, however, point out some few of the
salient factors involved. It has been shown that, so
far as Class A is concerned, to do <em>right</em> is to proceed
directly and immediately, and along a straight line,
if possible, to the desired object. Such behavior requires
both strength and skill; from which it also
follows that a feeble, untrained body will be unable
to do “right” in a great many cases, simply because
it cannot reach its goal in the face of obstacles.
This is our common observation. Before a baby
learns to walk, it cannot proceed directly or immediately
across a floor. Neither can an exhausted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
man, unable to use the sun for a compass, find his
way to safety out of a tropical forest. For a person
in his predicament, things are not likely to come out
“right.” Furthermore, in a great many cases of the
same sort, skill and strength are <em>both</em> required;
neither one alone is sufficient to attain the desired
end. Let now the psychologist tell the story of how
the attainment of skill depends upon a standard
equipment of sense organs, a sound and complete
brain, and muscles from which sensory stimuli elicit
precise responses. Let also the physiologist relate
here how bodily vigor likewise depends upon the interrelation
of internal functions: how the heart,
lungs, brain, muscles, thyroid, liver, and adrenals
all work together to make any effort successful and
complete. When this has been said, the meaning of
the word “right” as defined in Class A will have
been more fully revealed.</p>

<p>2. As deduced from Class B. Here the word
“right” is used to describe the method or object by
which any desire may be realized. The requirements
for membership in this class appear at first to
be less rigid than was the case with Class A. The
speed of motion that was stressed in the former
class is inessential here, as well as the necessity of
proceeding by the shortest course. Here also a
beefy body is not as imperative as are skill and sagacity.
But let us not make a favorite of either
class before we have heard the whole story. And
first let us ask, what is the typical action-pattern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
implied by Class B? The answer is not difficult to
give. There is a phrase, “selective excitability,”
which psychologists have long applied to the situation
where a sensori-motor mechanism is attuned by
practice to respond to one specific stimulus, and to
be entirely unresponsive to others. We exhibit this
selective excitability every time we take “our” hat
from the crowded coat-room, choose “our” favorite
cigar from a case full of attractive Havanas, or
fumble thoughtfully in “our” pocket for a cent to
give to the crouching beggar. In every such case,
we are said to employ the “right” object and perform
the “right” action. Actions of this sort involve
choice, which as we have already hinted (See
footnote, p. 32, Chap. II.), involves the use of one
member of a pair of antagonistic muscles. Consequently,
we may describe the action-pattern underlying
the use of “right” in Class B as any sort of behavior
which involves selective excitability and selective
activity. So that whatever Class B lacks in
generality as compared with Class A, is compensated
for by an increase in precision and, what is equally
important, by an <em>economy</em> of human energy in the
pursuit of the desired object. The importance of
this last factor has already been sufficiently hinted at
in the quotation that appears on the title-page of this
book.</p>

<p>3. As deduced from Class C. The change from
Class A to Class B involved an increase in what is
known as intelligence, that is, the ability to solve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
new problems. The change to Class C may be regarded
as involving a continued advance of the same
general character. But this change involves something
more. For, as we have already stated,
“right” now becomes “descriptive of any statement
which reports the facts: of any opinion or judgment
that is correct: and of any person who judges, thinks,
or acts in accordance with the facts or truth of a
matter.” Two changes in emphasis are consequently
to be noted here. First, the word “right”
is applied to utterances rather than to deeds alone;
and second, a metonomy is introduced in the application
of our concept to persons who make correct
statements. This shift of emphasis from an action
to the description of it, and from the description to
the describer need not cause us any difficulty, even
though it envisages for us a million years of the education
of the human race.</p>

<p>The success of our search for the meaning of our
concept is here dependent upon the function of speech
to imply and predict action,—a function which we
have already commented upon in our second chapter.
Words, like thoughts, are either reminiscent of overt
action, or else they assist in preparing us for it.
When, then, a man uses the word “right” to commend
either statements or persons, it is the same as
if he were to say: “Either there were, or there are,
or there may be, objects and events as you describe,
and I think as you do about them.” The action-pattern
here implicated is plainly that of <em>belief</em>. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
involves a lowered threshold with respect to the person
or statement called “right,” and a correspondingly
higher threshold toward those persons or statements
which contradict what is accepted. And as
was the case with Class B, this action-pattern involves
the use of one of the halves of a system of
antagonistic muscles, since the “emphasis here is
upon true opinions and judgments in contrast to
false ones.” This, however, is not all that can be
said upon this point. For every case of belief is a
case of constitutional readiness so to respond. And
while we do not exactly know how the body provides
such predeterminations, if the theory of action-patterns
is sound, the conjecture is not unfounded
that belief is a function of chronic postures maintained
in the muscles of the voluntary system.</p>

<p>Evidences in favor of this conjecture are readily
supplied from our everyday scrutiny of the faces of
our fellow-men. The beggar’s hand is actually a different
hand than the hand of the donor; as he sits
on the sidewalk, his predetermination to receive
alms is patent in the chronic posture of even his palm
and fingers. The courtesan not only manifests her
willingness to exchange smiles by the chronic postures
in her eyelids and mouth, but with a fitness that
a De Maupassant might celebrate, she also acquires
a carriage that betokens her particular vocation.
Contrariwise, the generous, affable man gives evidence
that his traits are at least muscle-deep; while
every actor will confess that if he gets into the adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
posture, the character he is depicting is automatically
portrayed. Those who pray also confess
that there are certain bodily attitudes which hinder,
and others which assist, the flow of sentiment which
they desire. Photographic evidences such as these,
however, are not the only proofs we possess of postural
predeterminations of action and thought, for
it is sound physiology that in the multifariously complex
musculature of the body, there are unnoticed
postural tensions being generated and maintained all
the while. And since, according to the all-or-none
principle of nervous and muscular activity, every
motor tendency is a truly positive physiological
event, whenever we manifest belief, some part of
the body is preparing to execute a movement appropriate
to the assertion implied. Indeed, we may
safely postulate that a large portion of what we
call our individuality is a function of those chronic
postures which our habits have hitherto established
in our motor mechanism,—which postures ever
thereafter determine what we shall do, say, and
believe.</p>

<p>4. As deduced from Class D. Here the word
“right” is used to signify “the hand which is normally
the stronger,” whence, by association, it refers
to a variety of related things, as hitherto indicated.
We have previously noted that the concept “right”
is a term we often use when the attainment of a
purpose is under consideration, and here we again
see the same motif displayed. Everybody knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
that the “right” hand is important in the acquisition
of skill of all sorts, and in getting in touch with the
things we call “good.” Evidences of the paramount
usefulness of the “right” hand to carry out
overt actions are ubiquitous. Moreover, levers,
pliers, and a hundred other tools are simply extensions
of its functions and magnifications of its powers.
What, then, are the action-patterns suggested
by this use of our concept? The answer is extremely
simple. The action-patterns we seek are
the innumerable activities of the <em>right</em> hand itself.
For, as we have previously shown, even to think
of the hand involves neuro-muscular activity in it.
What the right hand <em>does</em>, is what the concept
“right,” as applied to the hand, <em>means</em>. And if,
for any reason, the “right” hand is incapacitated or
missing, some other part of the body executes the
appropriate gesture or manœuvre.</p>

<p>5. As deduced from Class E. The transition
from Class D to Class E is made on the basis of a
common element that is shared by both. We have
just seen that the “right” hand is the stronger and
the more adroit, and that consequently it is the one
more adequately equipped to turn our wishes into
wills. No logician, then, is required to convince us
that legal “right,” in the sense of being equivalent
to might, connotes the same sort of strength and
force as are involved in the grasp and tug of the
hand. Were the policeman the pure embodiment of
legal “rights,” the action-patterns implied by Class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
E would be easy to determine, since they would be
simply the total behavior of that functionary while
on his beat. The problem before us is, to be sure,
not quite so easy of solution as reference to the policeman
would make it, but nevertheless, our previous
discussion of legal “right” has hinted just what that
solution is to be. For legal “rights” are one and all
concerned with the security of whatever things a
man calls <em>his</em>, together with the adjustment of conflicting
claims regarding them. To enumerate in
detail all the action-patterns here implied would be
equivalent to making an inventory of all the deeds
that had ever been performed to preserve property,
life, and personality, and to maintain and restore
peace and order in society. Let the historian open
his books and show us the panorama of these
achievements. And while we should see upon many
of his pages portrayals of torpid conservatism, ruthless
domineering, and magnificent cunning, we should
also behold examples of that impersonal referee of
whom we have already spoken, whose business it is
to persuade and oblige the disturbers of the social
equilibrium to employ the methods and standards
of conduct which have always marked free men.
He who would clearly comprehend such a panorama
must needs give it more than a fugitive glance; for
as it required time to be created, so does it require
time in which to be appreciated.</p>

<p>6. As deduced from Class F. Moral “rights”
are all those unsecured claims and inexactly specified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
interests whose only protection is the approval
and disapproval of the community, reinforced at
times by an appeal to a super-human protagonist.
A comparison between the motor-attitudes implied
by Class E and Class F reveals several important
differences. Juristic thinking, which we may for
convenience characterize as the attitude implied by
Class E, is on the whole logically coherent; moralistic
thinking, on the contrary, commits every known
logical fallacy. Again, juristic thinking is content
to regard human problems capable of solution at
the hands of human beings, and to consider that the
verdicts of unruffled men and of men expert in their
lines is final; while moralistic thinking is ever prone
to employ methods which, on account of their provincialism
and importunity, do not stand analysis at
the hands of unbiased investigators. Finally, the
“higher judge” which moralists assert stands behind
the claims they make, is simply a misinterpretation
of the meaning of long unrelieved tensions which
have accumulated in their skeletal muscles. For
while we do not declare that all claims unsecured by
law are ethically invalid, we do nevertheless assert
that the typical moralist’s attitude toward all such
unsecured claims is not one that is suited to bridge
the gap between our liquid matter and its good.
Nevertheless, we may say without equivocation that
behind every declaration of moral rights there is an
anxiety lest some dependable good be lost, and this
motor attitude we conceive to be the greatest common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
divisor of all the significations included under
Class F.</p>

<p>7. As deduced from Class G. Although this
class resembles the preceding one in that it refers to
customs whose maintenance depends upon the approval
and disapproval of the group, Class G lacks
all of the fiercely Stoical and Puritanical elements
found in Class F, just as it lacks the logical rigor
pertaining to Class E. The action-patterns implied
by this present class are rather those of a courteous
gentleman, who persuades whenever he can by a gesture,
but who does not try twice to persuade those
who will not yield to that kind of a suggestion.</p>

<p>8. As deduced from Class H. Since “right” here
signifies that which is convenient, desirable, favorable,
etc., the action-patterns which it implies are
practically identical with those of the first three
classes of “good.” Certainly every example previously
cited under this class points to an outgoing
reaction.</p>

<p>9. As deduced from Class I. The adverbial use
of our concept here implies merely a gesture of positive
emphasis that may be added to any other action-pattern.</p>

<p>Having previously sorted the manifold significations
of the word “right” among these nine classes,
and having subsequently shown what the organism
was doing when it employed this word with respect
to each of these classes, it now remains to discover
whether any one action-tendency is commonly hinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
by each and all of these nine classes. If such a common
tendency can be discovered, the word “right”
may then indeed be said to possess all these various
significations indicated in our array; otherwise, we
shall err in considering it to be one and the same
word in all the examples previously cited. In attempting
to discover and certify such a common
tendency, moreover, we shall employ the same
method suggested for the summarizing of the meanings
of the word “good.” We recognize that in the
title by which each class of “right” is denoted, there
is no presumption that such a title does more than
indicate the general trend of that class; logically, the
titles merely imply the greatest common divisors of
the many phrases included in the classes. So that
when we now attempt to define the common tendency
in all the action-patterns we have just deduced from
these nine classes, we are to consider only their similarities,
while discarding their differences. There
is nothing novel in this method; it is simply the
way in which all concepts have been unconsciously
derived.</p>

<p>Such a common tendency is not difficult to discover.
Each class as we defined it in behavioristic
terms turned out to imply an action-tendency that
played an important part in the behavior of human
beings while in the pursuit of the objects they desire,
or in the attainment of their ends, however variously
conceived or projected. Let us, then, bring the
whole matter to a focus by saying that <em>whenever we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
describe a behavior situation in which the dominant
feature is the controlling and directing of human
energies, the employment of technique to further
man’s purposes, or the attaining of any good whatsoever,
the critical word is “right.</em>” This is, indeed,
what our concept, as we have analysed it, finally
<em>means</em>.</p>

<p>Further than this a strictly scientific ethics does
not go, and, moreover, further than this no intellectually
honest man will go. Right simply means
what people use the word to signify,—employing it
either as a gesture to point out some object or relationship
in the environment, or else as an index of
what sort of behavior may be expected of them in
the future. Accordingly, all insistence on a “higher
and immutable right” as <em>the one real</em> meaning of the
term is either a sign of mal-observation or of logorrhea.
And if anyone still insists on knowing how
one determines what is <em>right</em>, we refer such a person
to our array of 114 terms, where in each case the
basis for such determination can be inferred. But
if such a person still demands an ultimate and irrefutable
criterion, the only thing left for him to do is
to attempt to be God; but it is suggested in advance
that the role of deity might, under the circumstances,
be even more difficult to play than the more familiar
rôle of man.</p>

<p>This comparison obviously reveals no basis for
the statement that “wrong” and “right” are complete
antitheses to each other, at least in the fine
sense that <em>up</em> is the opposite of <em>down</em>, <em>in</em> of <em>out</em>, or
<em>east</em> of <em>west</em>. So that, if we accept the word “right”
as descriptive of a behavior situation in which the
dominant feature is the controlling and directing of
human energies, the employment of technique to
further man’s purposes, or the attainment of any
“good” whatsoever, the word “wrong” cannot,—either
according to the detailed list of its uses just
presented, or according to the above scheme of its
logical relationship to “right,”—be said to be the
true antonym of that word. The law of reciprocal
innervation does not, in its integrity, apply here.</p>

<p>How then shall we explain the fact that people so
habitually say and feel that “wrong” is the opposite
of “right,” if it cannot be admitted that antagonistic
muscles are always employed in the thoughts and the
acts to which these two words refer? Perhaps the
following interpretation will answer. Logicians
are accustomed to say that any universal proposition,
any sweeping statement, such as, “Every swan
is white,” or “No aliens need apply,” is contradicted
by the admission that one single exception is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
allowed. But obviously, such logical contradiction,
such admission of a lone but effective exception, is not
equivalent to granting that “No swans are white,”
or that “Every alien is requested to apply.” Nevertheless,
the tradition among logicians is that with
the granting of one such exception, the sweeping
statement originally made is held to be untrue, and
hence, false. In physiological terms (than which
there are none more fundamental), contradiction is
for the logician equivalent to a partial but effective
inhibition of any fully developed action-tendency.
When Plato would say, “You may all now come in
to dinner,” but is deterred by seeing Diogenes muddying
his feet in order to tread the more scornfully
on the clean banquet floor, Plato’s action-pattern of
wholesale, cordial invitation is suddenly interrupted.
And, <em>so far as Plato’s emotions are concerned</em>, the
need to make one important exception in his invitation,
is very much like having to turn the whole company
out of doors. This tendency for an emotional
repugnance to blot out all sense of proportion is
clearly illustrated in certain oft-repeated fables.
The story of the involuntary guest who had not on a
wedding garment, of the ninety and nine sheep, and
of the rich young man are cases in point. Similar
examples may be found in the behavior of any household.
The vexed hostess is heard complaining that
one little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i> on the part of her serving-girl
“completely spoiled the whole evening.” The sweet
young thing whose lover arrives a quarter of an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
later than his appointment accuses him of being elsewhere
enamoured to stay. The wife whose husband
forgets only one of her twenty birthdays since
their marriage often finds it impossible to overlook
the single, unhabitual fault. It is not that such people
crave or dote on perfection; they do nothing of
the sort: it is only that their behavior mechanisms
are unable to readjust quickly to another stimulus
than the one which they have expected, and this
failure to readjust releases energies by way of
the viscera instead of along other and more pacific
pathways.</p>

<p>All this has an important bearing on the meaning
of the word “wrong.” We saw that this word has
only 18 significations, as compared with the 114
significations of “right.” We also saw that it is
only partially antagonistic to the concept to which
it is commonly opposed. And it has further been
revealed that our customary logic makes a single
exception the grounds for an assumption of contradiction.
On the basis of these observations, then,
we may declare that “wrong” refers to some very
special behavior situations where human energies
cannot be controlled and directed as desired, where
the employment of technique to further man’s purposes
has been hindered, and where “good” cannot
be obtained. This, however, is not equivalent to
saying that “wrong” is the antonym, the unqualified
contradictory, of “right,” any more than red is the
opposite of blue, or coffee the opposite of tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>


<h3><em>A Physiological Warrant for Ethical Optimism</em></h3>

<p>A question of considerable importance both in
physiology and in ethics arises when we ask why the
concepts “right” and “good” have so many more
significations than do “wrong,” “evil,” and “bad.”
We have already emphasized the relation between
speech and conduct sufficiently to indicate that upon
the answer to such a question something essential for
a technique in ethics depends. A word can have a
great number of significations only by its being employed
in a great variety of situations, and this
means that very many different specific responses are
implicit in the use of our most comprehensive concepts.
Contrariwise, with a word of fewer significations,
fewer such responses are implied. Now
we have already cited the fact that “good” and
“right” refer primarily to outgoing (extensor) reactions,
and that “wrong,” “evil,” and “bad” signify
withdrawing (flexor) reactions. Are we, then,
summarily to conclude, without any further knowledge
of the body’s mechanisms, that since we seem
to use our extensor system in a more diversified manner
than our flexor system, the muscular equipment
of the former is superior to that of the latter?</p>

<p>If we do so conclude, we shall be in error. It is
the opposite that is nearer the truth. Both larger
and stronger, and, on the whole, more easily educated
muscles exist in the flexor than in the extensor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
system. The innumerable capacities of the half-closed
hand are representative of this superiority.
Still more important, however, is the fact that the
flexor system is practically the dominant system in
the human body. The hinges of the knee, hip,
shoulder, elbow, wrist, and jaw are more often, more
strongly, and more readily closed maximally than
they are expanded to the full. Besides, occupational
postures are almost universally crystallized
withdrawing responses. Where, then, shall we look
for the answer to our question?</p>

<p>We shall look directly at the behavior of the organism
as a whole. While it is admitted that flexor
actions are stronger, more numerous, and more universal
than are extensor reactions, yet when we consider
how the flexor reactions dispose the body toward
its environment, we shall at once have light
on this curious problem. For the effect of such reactions
is to cut off the body from a large part of
the environment, and consequently to reduce the
possibility of effective contact with it. Stooping,
crouching, bowing the head, and lowering the eye
are significant examples of flexor responses which reduce
the span of perception, while every man knows
that activities of the opposite character allow a
greater number of stimuli to come in contact with
his eyes and his ears. Consequently, even though
flexor actions will always be in the majority, extensor
actions have the advantage of providing the conditions
under which a greater variety of stimuli can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
presented to the organism. This is the same as
saying that the open-minded person necessarily becomes
discriminative and exploratory, while the opposite
type is left to stew in his own juice. The
flexor type of man is, indeed, in the end reduced to
contacts with his own body, while to the extensor
type of man his body is only one of the many sources
of motivation, the rest being in the external environment.
It seems thus to be primarily due to the very
mechanics of the organism that the words “right”
and “good” have a greater variety of significations
than have the words “bad,” “evil,” and “wrong.”</p>

<p>One additional word, however, can still be said.
As we have already indicated, these three so-called
negative ethical concepts are all descriptive of behavior
situations in which thwarting and inhibition
are dominant symptoms. Henceforth, however,
thwarting and inhibition will be understood as temporary
interruptions of an outgoing reaction which
would have eventuated had the environment contained
the stimulus to which the organism was attuned
to respond. As we say in common speech, a
desire is not satisfied by being denied, and from our
every-day experience we know that great aggravations
produce as much scheming as do our easiest
successes. He who casts his eye over the numerous
significations of our two positive ethical concepts
will now realize where much of the adroitness and
sagacity which characterizes them originates.</p>

<p>In these two simple facts, namely, that extensor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
actions bring more of the world of action within our
range, and that even the thwarted man imaginatively
explores the environment to find substitute stimuli
to release his energy upon, we find the reason why
man has more uses for the words “right” and
“good” than he has for the words “bad,” “evil,” and
“wrong.” And with this we achieve by a purely
empirical and anti-supernaturalistic method a physiological
warrant for ethical optimism. If anyone
is looking for a “higher” truth, let him ponder
this one.</p>

“VIRTUE” AND “VICE” AS FUNCTIONS
OF THE ORGANISM</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“In nearly all these philosophic discussions of ethics one
has somehow the haunting sense of a wrongness of direction.
Virtue is somehow imposed from above, it is descending
upon us. And the unfortunate part of this is that
it has to descend very low indeed before it reaches us; and
when there, it has lost the buoyancy wherewith to lift us
up.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Edwin Holt</span>, “The Freudian Wish.”<br>
</p>
</div>


<p>In the foregoing analysis of the five most frequently
used ethical concepts we have had to feel
our way rather carefully, inasmuch as a completely
new path was being cut through the tangle of human
experience; henceforth, however, our task will be
somewhat easier, since we shall now be able to apply
the truth we have already discovered in the remainder
of our investigations. Directly, then, we shall
proceed to ask what another pair of ethical antonyms,
namely, virtue and vice, signify in terms of
our physiological functions.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that our first five ethical concepts
were rather largely employed to point out
objects and relationships in the external environment.
It is common to speak of <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
automobile tires, of the <em>right</em> golf club to use near
a bunker, of the <em>wrong</em> side of a sheet of drawing
paper, and of the <em>evil</em> that men do which lives after
them. When, however, we take up the study, first
of “virtue” and “vice,” and later on, that of “conscience,”
“duty,” and “freedom,” we are no longer
to be primarily concerned with things outside of the
organism, but rather with processes going on within
it. Significantly enough, this deepening of our absorption
into the field of ethics involves a further
penetration into the realm of physiology. Thus in
a curious and unforeseen way our fundamental thesis
with regard to the close relationship between physiology
and ethics obtains additional support. Consequently,
we are not to turn suddenly from objective
to subjective ethics, as has usually been the case
when the five concepts we are forthwith to analyse
have been discussed; on the contrary, just as we began
by defining ethical values in terms of human activities,
so shall we continue until we have made an
end. And although it is commonly asserted that the
deepest meanings are <em>inner</em> meanings, yet in a universe
that has neither an inside, nor an outside, nor
an edge, such a figure of speech simply betokens an
introversive tendency on the part of him who uses it.</p>

<p>Herewith, also, the need to combat another
equally stultifying tendency is manifest. I refer to
the proclivity of all second-rate minds to reify abstract
terms. “Virtue” and “vice” have been so
reified, as have likewise “conscience,” “duty,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
“freedom” to such an extent as to make it almost
impossible to get a fair hearing for any one who
wishes to discover the sources from which these
concepts have been derived. It is admitted, of
course, that the evolution of man has been greatly
hastened by his ability to make and use abstract
terms; but when a man uses an abstract term without
knowing or caring from what sources it has been
derived, he is manifesting little more than a desire
to escape from reality.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Indeed, it might be said
that unless the use of abstractions assists us in dealing
more effectively with concrete persons and
things, it is time to regret that language has been
universally acquired.</p>

<p>The terms “virtue” and “vice,” therefore, instead
of being treated as abstract entities which existed
even prior to man’s advent on the planet, and which
will survive his leave-taking of it, will be here regarded
simply as words by which a man describes
the behavior of himself and of his fellows. And,
as was the case five times previously, our definitions
of these particular concepts will be the result of a
search for the greatest common divisors of all the
particular virtues and vices respectively.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, however, no complete catalogue
of either the virtues or the vices exists. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
every list which the different philosophies and religions
furnish reflects a different bias or determining
tendency. One need only to scan the Platonic,
the Aristotelian, and the Christian inventories<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in
order to verify this remark. The determining tendency
thus revealed turns out upon analysis to contain
two elements:—first, the desire to reduce the
essential virtues to the smallest number possible, and
second, the inclination to rank them from the highest,
or supreme virtue, to the lowest. Such a procedure
as the latter,—that of building the edifice of
virtue down from the top,—is, in our estimation, no
part of a scientific method in ethics. Neither does
it tell us what <em>a</em> virtue is. Besides, as might be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
from such biased and provincial system-making,
what one philosophy or religion calls a virtue,
may be classified by another as a vice. Witness
the ambiguous status of <em>humility</em> as treated now by
the followers of Nietzsche, and again by the early
Christians. Perhaps, however, such ambiguities
may be traced to the fact that the term “vice” is of
uncertain etymology, while no such perplexity arises
concerning the origin of the word “virtue.”</p>

<p>This lack of unanimity or completeness in the various
invoices of virtue is not in any way fatal to our
purpose. In spite of special emphases philosophies
and religions may exhibit or insist upon, every particular
virtue is undeniably <em>some quality, trait, or
performance which is admired or esteemed</em>. Taking
this description as our point of departure, let us
first consider what sort of traits and performances
have been thus commended, after which we shall be
able to discover to what an extent virtue and vice
are contradictory. For it is by no means obvious at
the start that they are true antonyms.</p>

<p>Let it be recognized, then, that the original signification
of virtue refers to the so-called manly or
noble qualities of bravery, valor, daring, courage,
and the like. From this it is inferable that just as
<em>might</em> and <em>right</em> were found to have much in common,
so do virtue and physical power. Perhaps the
biologist would call this phase of virtue a manifestation
of positive thigmotaxis, that is, the tendency
to face and fight against physical obstacles. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
might also call these manly or noble qualities the
<em>spectacular</em> virtues, since he who displays them is
always subject-matter for the dramatist, whether a
man exhibit his valor in the midst of a crowd on
Broadway, or alone in the fastnesses of the Yukon.
How far this sort of virtue can be attributed to the
dumb animals has not yet become part of ethical
inquiry. In Plato’s Dialogue “Laches” Socrates
argues that the virtue that is strength, in so far as it
pertains to human beings, contains an intellectual
element that is wanting in the lower animals, however
pluckily they may defend their young against
an intruder. Nevertheless, sympathetic and careful
observers of animal behavior are becoming more
and more convinced that the defence which such a
bird as the penguin makes against the egg-eating
skua-gulls is just as courageous an act, and therewith
just as virtuous, as that of a weak nation
against a mighty invader. Reduced to its lowest
terms, every act of bravery is the same: it is only
the interests involved which make the sacrifices of
Regulus and Andreas Hofer seem fundamentally
different from those of dumb animals at bay before
the merciless hunter. But evidences of a growing
doubt on this point are manifest today in the fact
of our awarding hero-medals to dogs and horses
in the same manner as we award them to men.</p>

<p>A second class of traits which have been traditionally
commended includes such things as caution,
probity, temperance, sobriety, honesty, and the like.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
These virtues are at once seen to lack the theatrical
or spectacular quality which attaches to displays
of physical courage or intrepidity. They might,
therefore, perhaps be called the <em>unobtrusive</em> virtues.
It is not to be understood, however, that these unobtrusive
virtues require any less physical energy
than do those with which they have just been contrasted.
To be sure, the energy expended is on the
whole less suddenly released, for it may involve far
more work to acquire the habitual trait of honesty
than to be gallant for an hour or so on the field of
battle. Perhaps it is due to the recognition of this
fact that today raw physical fortitude is not the
first association which the mention of “virtue” calls
up in our minds.</p>

<p>A third use of the term “virtue” signifies any inherent
property capable of producing certain effects,
in which connection it particularly refers to the
medicinal efficacy of drugs distilled from plants.
This sort of virtue is <em>good for</em> something, and is
usually regarded as life-enhancing.</p>

<p>Finally, this concept appears in certain familiar
phrases, such as “by virtue of,” “in virtue of,” and
the like, where it usually connotes <em>strength</em>, or <em>efficacy</em>,
or even <em>reason</em>, and <em>right</em>. Thus we see that
the word “virtue,” like the other ethical concepts
we have analysed, loses almost all of its specificity
when it enters into idiomatic phrases.</p>

<p>These four classes exhaust the uses to which this
concept has been put. What, then, shall we declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to be the common element in them which we
may call the essence of virtue with respect to human
beings? In giving our answer, it is necessary to
call attention to the fact that our third use of the
word “virtue” (signifying the medicinal efficacy of
drugs) will occupy a minor, or even negligible
place in our definition. As for the rest, seeing that
the virtues are one and all traits which are commended
or praised, they may be considered as
action-patterns or action-tendencies which human
beings manifest. We can also go further than this.
Employing the physiological principles hitherto used
in defining ethical concepts, it appears at once that
the word “virtue” means that <em>energy is either being
mobilized or expended to obtain what the organism
considers to be a dependable good</em>. This can also
be stated in another way, by saying that those human
traits which have been expressly denominated
virtues are some of the attributes of what is commonly
called a “good” man. (See Ex. 21, p. 38.)
In this restricted sense, furthermore, the <em>virtuous</em>,
or <em>good</em>, man is the one whose acts are called <em>right</em>.
And this leads us at once to a very important
question.</p>

<p>Why is it, we ask, that so few of the innumerable
human traits that are commended every day—not
only by words of praise, but also by that subtler and
more emphatic sign of unconscious imitation—have
been chosen as virtues, while so many others
have been left out of the list? The four cardinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
virtues,—courage, prudence, temperance, and justice,—exemplify
this high degree of selectiveness,
while this inventory omits all mention of human
skill in any form, in spite of the fact that when the
list was made by Plato, human skill in the fine arts
had reached one of its limits of excellence.</p>

<p>The answer here sought is highly significant as a
comment upon ethical speculation in a pre-scientific
age. The list of cardinal virtues is merely an index
of the bias of its maker with regard to the outstanding
problems of his own time. These four
traits which Plato elevated to the top of his system
are not, then, to be taken as an indication of what
Plato saw most frequently exhibited by the citizens
of Athens, but, if anything, just the contrary. Anyone
who has read Plato’s “Republic” will recall
that his aim was to describe an ideal, that is, a
not-yet-existing state, and that these four virtues
were lauded, not because they had been found in
actual life to be either sufficient or practicable, but
rather because they seemed to Plato to fit into his
ideal scheme. Now it is seldom denied that courageous
men, prudent men, temperate men, and just
men are to be soundly commended, or do we in any
sense deny it here. Our only question is, Should
these four traits be called the cardinal or supreme
virtues before the whole list of commendable traits
has been scrutinized? The answer which the
scientifically trained mind gives is in the negative.
Something else, however, is even more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
for the foundation of an empirical ethics, namely,
the question: Are those traits which we <em>openly</em>
praise to be regarded, in the study of actual conduct,
of prior importance to those which, by being unconsciously
imitated, receive our silent, and therewith
more significant approval? This, however, is the
same as asking whether man has ever dared to face
with courage and sincerity the real ethical problem.</p>

<p>A glance at another well-known list of selected
virtues reveals even less of a tendency toward the
statistical method in ethics than even Plato showed.
We refer to those significantly unobtrusive virtues
which characterized the ethics of primitive Christianity,
and which were doubtless derived from the
Beatitudes. Readers of the English Bible may recall
that the epithet “blessed” was employed by
Jesus to describe (1) those who were poor in spirit,
(2) those who mourn, (3) the meek, (4) those who
hunger and thirst after righteousness, (5) the
merciful, (6) the pure in heart, (7) the peacemakers,
(8) those who have been persecuted for
righteousness’ sake, (9) those falsely reproached,
(10) the poor, and (11) those who weep, which
persons, in the average, are an entirely different
class of organisms from those whom Plato would
have called “blessed,” that is, commendable.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
There is evidence to believe that this novel emphasis
upon a certain type of person,—a type hitherto
openly unpraised in the ethical thought of man,—gave
rise to the tendency to elevate such traits as
humility, kindliness, self-denial, meekness, patience,
and the like, to a supreme position in the minds of
primitive Christians.</p>

<p>However, this class of virtues is again not to be
considered as indicative of the only traits which
people commend, either openly, or by more subtle
and significant signs. It is even safe to say that no
group of Christians, be it either small or large,
existing in a remote or a modern generation, were
ever naïvely satisfied, or brought by dint of training,
to act on the principle that these unobtrusive traits
were the chief virtues. The reason for this plainly
lies in the one-sidedness of such traits. Paulsen, in
his “System of Ethics,” points out that whereas the
Greeks found positive values in (1) scientific knowledge,
(2) esthetic and other pleasures, (3) temperance,
(4) courage, (5) justice, (6) honor and
high-mindedness, (7) bodily cultivation, (8) economic
solvency, (9) family life, and (10) the state,
the early Christians considered almost none of
these things to be worth their while. And whereas
it would be more or less insulting to the memory
of Jesus to call the doctrines of the early Christians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
an extension of his teachings, yet we can say that
the unobtrusive virtues which early official Christianity
sought to emphasize, are one and all withdrawing
reactions, and as such must be rejected as
the sole basis of a scientific ethics.</p>

<p>We reject them because they are not based upon
a sufficient consideration of the total needs of man’s
body,—that on which his life and mind depend.
Man has not only a flexor system, but an extensor
system of muscles as well, and it must be plain from
the discussions in the preceding chapters that both
of these systems are ethical mechanisms. However,
official Christianity has often seen fit, by its exclusive
emphasis upon those virtues which involve withdrawing
reactions, literally to declare that the extensor
system shall be denied a stimulus. The
Greeks were far wiser; for even though they may
have failed to achieve a conception of virtue which
took into consideration the wholesome balance between
flexor and extensor activities, they nevertheless
did not err in propounding a doctrine that
ignored the simplest principles of human behavior.</p>

<p>As a matter of historical record, primitive Christians
did not succeed, by the exhibition of these
unobtrusive virtues, in making themselves either inconspicuous
or immune to their persecutors. If
anything, indeed, they were all the more actively
hounded because of their queer traits. And why?
For the simple reason that the typical Christian
virtues, being withdrawing reactions, and consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
allied to and confused with the attitudes
of secretiveness and dissimulation, led the Roman
officials quite reasonably to suspect that the early
Christians were dangerous to the state. And it can
be substantiated that primitive Christianity was far
from being a patriotic movement. In those days,
at least, the man who did not retaliate a blow was
regarded first with amazement, then with contempt,
then fear, and finally with the most diabolical
hatred. Such a silent man might know something
very important, might have knowledge of a world-wide
insurrection ready to break tonight. Tear him
to pieces, then; he shall at least not maintain that
exasperating smile! How is such a meek man
“blessed”? It may be true that our sentiments can
partially apologize for a system of ethics based
upon the functions of the flexor system alone, yet the
sense of proportion which we inherit from the
Greeks demands that we strike out on new paths
which are not littered with the blunders of the past.</p>

<p>We must not forget to say, however, that one
reason why these unobtrusive virtues have been
given a chief place, not only in official Christianity,
but also in Mohammedanism and Buddhism, is because
of the simple, even though disquieting, fact
that the flexor system is by nature stronger than the
extensor system. Man, then, is by endowment
more inclined to be humble and secretive than to be
bold and frank, since the larger and stronger and
more often activated muscles of his body are those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
which produce withdrawing reactions. That is also
why man is prone to introspection, and to cultivate
an inner life, and why also, to borrow a phrase of
Dr. Morton Prince, he is frequently more interested
in his own “mental mud-puddle” than in the external
environment. Again, this physiological fact is responsible
for each man having his own house, his
nest, into which he retreats to escape from the novelties
he can no longer adjust to, and where he may
“bathe his receptors in comfort-giving stimuli.”
And so, one is finally tempted to say that the unobtrusive
virtues have obtained such a vogue because
they are the only ones which over sixty per cent of
mankind can appreciate and will ever really attempt
to achieve. Perhaps, also, it is for the same reason
that today the word “virtue” signifies almost exclusively
<em>chastity</em>, a trait of character and an action-pattern
which any physician will tell you is dependent
for its existence and maintenance upon the
contractions of very powerful flexor muscles.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this discussion is that from the
study of man’s body as an ethical machine, it appears
that he who would formulate a list of the chiefly
desirable traits or virtues should first carefully consider
the total needs of the organism. This new
catalogue of virtues will be based upon the realization
that man possesses both a flexor and an extensor
mechanism. We know already that many ailments
of the body are traceable to a lop-sided use of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
by which is usually meant the acquisition of chronic
fatigue-postures in the flexor muscles. Indeed,
chronic postures are recognized to be of such paramount
importance, that experts have been employed
to devise adequate stretching exercises (actuating the
disused extensor system) in order to restore the organic
balance of a nation. Moreover, just as the
hygiene of the body depends upon a liberal use of all
of its muscles, so likewise the ethical balance of the
organism can be maintained only by the cultivation
and commendation of a sufficient variety of traits to
provide an outlet for all the action-tendencies which
man naturally possesses. Virtue, then, we may
henceforth regard as being based directly upon our
physiological needs, and not upon the assumption,
so frequently employed in the past, that ideals
must be unattainable in order to be respectable.</p>

<p>Moreover, a strictly natural science of ethics will
have a regard for the fact of individual differences
among men, and, recognizing that blood-pressure,
metabolism, talents, and capacities differ so widely
as to make it impossible for any one trait to be
the “highest” virtue for all persons, it will place the
emphasis solely upon the needs of the individual
case. Already this development has become wide-spread.
The juvenile courts, the Society for Mental
Hygiene, the National Child Welfare Association
are all examples of an ethical technique based entirely
upon the sciences of physiology, psychology,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and medicine. This emancipation of ethics from
official religion is one of the most momentous events
in the history of civilization.</p>

<p>And finally, we may say that it is time to recognize
that since each one of the “seven ages of man” has
its own particular mental and physical characteristics,
so likewise does each of these ages have its
own particular virtues. Too long have parents
whispered themselves into the belief that the child
ought to strive to copy the man, for the result of
this unconscious egotism has only forced such parents
to discover that when their child has grown up,
they immediately wanted him to be an infant again!
But it is becoming recognized among those who
learn to look at the world without such an exaggerated
self-preference, that every phase of life,—infancy,
puberty, youth, manhood, middle-age,
maturity, and senescence,—brings with it ever new
ethical opportunities in the appearance of traits
peculiar to each phase, and that it is in the development
of these various potentialities into their
own natural end-product that the ultimate ethical
values consist.</p>


<h3><em>Is Vice the Opposite of Virtue?</em></h3>

<p>It now remains to be seen what the word “vice”
means, first by scanning the uses to which it is
popularly put, and second, by reference to its physiological
implications. Accordingly, then, we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the following general classes of things called vices.</p>

<p>Any fault, mistake, or error may be called a vice,
as, for instance, a “vice of method.” This signification
is practically identical with one use of the term
“bad.” (E. g., bad workmanship, defective, below
par; sometimes called poor or worthless.)</p>

<p>Likewise, any imperfection, defect, or blemish
falls under this category, as “a vice of conformation,”
“a vice of literary style.” Here again this
use of the concept may be identified with some of the
significations of “bad” and “wrong.” These first
two classes of vice may be related to one another in
the sense that the first is the cause, and the latter the
effect,—the erroneous (vicious) method producing
the blemish (vice) in the product.</p>

<p>In our third class are found the significations most
commonly implied by this concept today, namely,
those habits or actions contrary to public policy, and
especially those which arouse violent censure. Such
are gluttony, indolence, mendacity, drunkenness,
debauchery, and the like, which might also be included
in any complete list of the things which are
called “bad,” “evil,” and “wrong.” The peculiarly
specific element which enters here, however, is
the damage to the organism which these vices entail.
Sometimes, also, this concept is used in the expression,
“an age of vice,” a phrase which denotes a
period of time in which these censured practices are
extremely prevalent, or given particular notice.</p>

<p>The term “vice” is also used in describing animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
not thoroughly trained, as when it is said: “That
bird-dog has the vice of mouthing the quarry,” or “I
must break this horse of his vice of cribbing.”</p>

<p>Formerly, indeed, some inherited bodily defects
were spoken of as “constitutional vices,” but this
use of the term is now rare.</p>

<p>It can be seen at once that while virtue and vice
are popularly regarded as opposites, no amount of
stretching applied to either of these concepts will
make it the true antonym of the <em>other</em>. It is idle
for anyone to remark that they ought nevertheless
to be regarded as diametrically opposed; empirically
they are not, as the following analytical table plainly
shows:—</p>

<p>How, now, shall we proceed to construct our
definition of the ethical concept “vice”? It will be
recalled that we used the term virtue to describe a
situation in which energy was being either mobilized
or expended to obtain what the organism considered
to be a dependable good. Does vice imply the
opposite of this? Hardly, for it must be admitted
by the uncensorious observer that many of even the
most violently condemned actions could be described
as part of somebody’s program to attain a durable
satisfaction. The glutton, remembering once more
how comfortable a full belly makes him feel, may
gorge himself without stint; and even if he has been
warned that diabetes and gout are likely to be the
final results of such persistent devotion to the pastry
and the roast, he may still pursue these foods with
avidity, cheerfully and hopefully making himself an
exception to the general rule of impending disaster.
In the same way, the lusty pursuer of sex enjoyments
may be dispassionately regarded as planning
and achieving his own type of satisfaction, and while
he may often “in a cool hour” be aware of the likelihood
of entangling alliances, yet even his self-censure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
is not guaranteed to keep him from mobilizing
his energy for the attainment of his chosen,
private “good.”</p>

<p>Once more, then, we realize that “virtue” and
“vice” are not true antonyms. We saw this to be
the case with “good” and “bad,” and likewise with
“right” and “wrong.” It is only when these pairs
of terms are used with the most severely restricted
denotation, that is, with a provincial bias, that their
opposition and contradiction appears. Such bias is
also shown, when it is said that the glutton and the
debauché “really know that they shouldn’t” indulge
themselves as they do, a statement which signifies
something like this: If these men who do
what I call “wrong” were only to act as I direct,
they would not be censured. Obviously so, but
what a host of fallible assumptions this involves! It
is merely ignoring the problem, and such a treatment
furnishes no hint as to its solution. One begins to
doubt the validity of all praise and blame as profitable
ethical instruments. Besides, the appeal to
self-censure, as employed in the above case, is, in the
end, relatively inefficacious in actual practice, and is
hence illogical as a basic principle in ethical theory.
Indeed, it is idle to say that we all know what we
should do; if we had that much information, we
would act upon it, for the will and the intellect, as
Spinoza remarked, are one and the same. The
great need in ethics is to get right down to the
empirical facts of conduct and to let them teach us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
rather than to hide the facts behind a screen of
pious insincerity. Importunate chiding may be a
traditional tool of morality, but it does not contribute
anything to the establishment of an ethical
science.</p>

<p>Consequently we shall have to reject any definition
of the vices which goes no further than to
describe them as those actions which some observer
regards as unprofitable. It may be that such a definition
superficially fits a great many cases, but great
danger lies in accepting it without scrutiny, since it
tends to imply that ethics is merely a study of <em>opinions</em>
about conduct, and not of conduct itself. Now,
no other science is a study of opinions, not even the
normative sciences of bridge-building or landscape
gardening; and ethics is no exception to this general
rule. Moreover, since we do not know of any
absolutely wise observer to whose opinion we can
appeal in every doubtful case, a true definition of
vice has not yet been achieved.</p>

<p>However, if we bear in mind that praise and
blame, or commendation and censure are always
relative to certain environmental conditions, and if,
furthermore, we can discover what they really imply,
we shall doubtless be able to arrive at a conception
of virtue and vice that will square with the observable
facts of human conduct. And the first point to
be emphasized is that whenever these concepts are
used, some standard seems to be implied. What is
this seemingly hidden standard, this presupposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
line, which, especially in the case of the vices, one is
forbidden to cross under pain of censure? Sometimes
it seems to be a line drawn within a family,
sometimes within a neighborhood, while often it is
confined to a class or profession, and again it is
delimited by a national culture. Would it not seem
that every such tacitly assumed standard is created
by the relatively unconscious judgment of the group
in the very effort to have a group, the members of
which recognize each other as belonging to it? In
other words, are not all such standards a function
of the desire of the group to employ the pronouns
“we” and “us” significantly? This is not oversimplifying
the matter, since the use of such pronouns
implies much more than is commonly realized.
Indeed, when man says “we” instead of “I,” he indicates
that a point in evolution has been reached
where a similarity of predicaments has produced a
similarity of aims. To fight a common foe, to till
a common land, and to keep a common eye upon
strangers are one and all actions implicit in the establishment
of group standards. And even though
these standards are often ill-defined, and frequently
neglected by certain individuals within the group,
nevertheless they remain as a background of reference
(in strict mechanistic terms, as an old habit-posture),
whenever there is any danger felt lest
the word “we” should become meaningless. Danger
felt by whom? Particularly, we are obliged to
say, by the most conservative members of the group,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
for be it remembered that praise and blame, and
reward and punishment are insisted upon most
violently by undiscriminating persons. Such persons,
it seems, are most sensitive to the waxing and
waning of certain benefits which others have
achieved for them, and which they regard as valuable
to retain and dangerous to lose.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to know what such benefits are
he has only to recall what traits his own group calls
virtues and vices, and to ask in every case just what
they imply in terms of the needs of the group which
sanctions or condemns them. For example, valor,
courage, and intrepidity, together with the other
spectacular virtues, have certainly been commended
because they supply two very obvious and well-nigh
universal group needs. The first is a common, stalwart
defence, and the second is a healthy progeny.
Cripples and deformed persons have never been objects
of admiration or praise. As for the unobtrusive
virtues, many of these have likewise been commended
by such a group as feels itself beset or insecure
on account of its inability to compete with
the strong on their own terms, and this group has
adopted them in a semi-paradoxical attempt to acquire
solidarity. To turn at once to the other side
of the picture, we find that the vices of gluttony,
drunkenness, and lechery have been condemned not
only because they effeminate and debilitate, and
thereby undermine the defence-power of the group,
but also because they tend to reduce the capacity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the group to create a sound and fertile offspring.
This is doubtless why certain congenital abnormalities
were formerly spoken of as “constitutional
vices.” As for the word “vice” being sometimes applied
to botchy work, incorrect methods, and the
faults of untrained animals, we can see how in
special instances a group might regard these things
as peculiarly detrimental to its solidarity. Contrariwise,
the “virtue” of a medicinal plant might,
under the harassing circumstances of a plague or an
epidemic, be the chief cause of even a nation’s
concern.</p>

<p>In thus defining virtue and vice in terms of the
assets and liabilities of the group, what becomes of
our previous attempt to define virtue in individualistic
terms? The answer is that this previous conception
remains as a necessary complement to, and
check upon, group intolerance. For while the desires
of the group and those of the individual may
sometimes clash, they do not need to be considered
as basically or essentially opposed to one another.
The historical fact is often manifest that when
group solidarity tends to produce mediocrity, there
is a sudden overt demonstration of individualism.
Our own generation shows an example of this type
of reaction. When, again, extreme individualism
fails to yield group assets, the conservative tendencies
begin to reassert themselves more powerfully
once more. Yet it is doubtful whether exactly
the same type of conservatism is ever repeated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
since the individualism which it seeks to counteract
is, in succeeding generations, different from the type
which preceded it.</p>


<h3><em>Is Virtue Its Own Reward?</em></h3>

<p>From the foregoing it is apparent that the ethical
concept “virtue” has two alternative interpretations.
One of these involves the commendation of the
group on the basis of what its members feel to be
required for the maintenance of its traditions. The
other interpretation is based upon what the individual
mobilizes and expends his energy to obtain.
Which of these is superior to the other, that is,
which would survive in case of mutual conflict, only
the last volume of recorded history will relate.
What is more of a real problem to us is the question,
commonly asked, Is virtue its own reward?</p>

<p>This curious question involves the philosophical
theory of internal relations,—a theory of very
doubtful validity. The statement that virtue is
its own reward is equivalent to the assertion that
virtue is valuable in and for itself. But if so,
then virtue is unique, and this again is doubtful, for
whether we observe the individual devoting his energies
to the attainment of some dependable good, or
the group commending him for it, it appears at once
that virtuous actions are never undertaken without
some hope of reward either in the shape of praise
or of tangible results. Upon hearing this, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
will groan, claiming that a good man should act
ever and only on principle, and leave the rest to the
gods. And yet nobody ever did so. Moreover, it
is plain that the truly virtuous man, whether acting
within the taboos of his clan, or striking out on entirely
new paths after a “good” that he could depend
securely upon, received a three-fold reward of a
very substantial nature. He achieved power, he
attained wisdom, and he secured peace; and these
rewards, moreover, in the degree to which they were
gained, automatically thereafter became the measure
by which the dependability of any good could be
estimated. And we also venture to say that the
same criterion could be employed in determining
to what extent any particular trait of character
was a vice.</p>

<p>Even more than this, however, can now be said.
For such a criterion as is here suggested has significant
implications for the human body,—that upon
which life and mind ultimately depend. Experiments
in psychology and psychiatry have revealed
that traits of character are more than skin-deep and
brain-deep; indeed, they are more than muscle-deep:
they are as deep as the vital organs themselves.
Even more than this is apparent, for these
same sciences have demonstrated that not only is
such a trait as anxiety just another name for a
chronic muscular tension, but also that many diseases
are, if not caused, at least abetted by what we think,
how we act, and what feelings we cultivate. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
more precise terms, the mechanisms of thought and
action, being partly identical with the mechanisms
of locomotion and metabolism, can produce either a
hygienic or an unhygienic effect upon the whole
structure of man’s organism. And in this fact, I
think, we can find an acceptable basis, even if a new
one, for the distinction between virtue and vice.</p>

<p>This basis we propose is not altogether a novelty
to keen students of human nature. We know that
the normal, healthy and successfully adapted human
individual is characterized by a relaxed and resilient
condition, not only of his superficial or locomotor
muscles, but also of the muscles of his alimentary
tract. Both his voluntary and involuntary systems
are constantly in a state of readiness to perform
their necessary functions, and they also return to this
condition after any series of actions has been performed.
Such a man possesses aplomb, and is an
example of the healthy Greek ideal of a sane mind in
a sound body. In striking contrast to such a normal,
resilient state, there are frequently found two
other organic conditions which are readily delineated.
The one is called muscular flabbiness, characterized
by a powerless or a-tonic state of the muscles
of either the voluntary (or teachable) and the
involuntary (or unteachable) systems, or both.
A man in this a-tonic plight is incapable of vigorous,
coordinate action, and his muscles do not manifest a
normal readiness to respond to successive stimulations.
The other abnormal condition, at the opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
pole from this one, is the one involving chronic
muscular tensions, a condition which may be compared
to the state of a steel spring which is always
kept under severe strain, and which is never released
far enough to give the metal a chance to recover
from the stresses it undergoes. Highstrung, over-anxious,
jealous, irascible people illustrate this type
of organism with exactness.</p>

<p>The ethical implications of the foregoing must
have already been guessed. Is it not possible to
define the virtuous man as the relaxed, resilient,
coordinate individual, and the vicious man as either
the muscularly flabby, and therewith the lazy, spineless,
procrastinating, lecherous man; or else as the
abnormally hypertonic organism, whose muscles constantly
pay dividends of wrath, and whose grudges
and malice are carried even through his slumber?
If so, there should be no paradox implied in speaking
of virtue and vice as functions of the human organism.</p>

<p>The word “conscience” was perhaps originally
synonymous with consciousness, but it gradually came
to mean <em>self</em>-consciousness of a very special type,
namely, the silent commendation or censure which a
man may bestow upon his actions or his projects.
This word “conscience” replaced the Middle English
term <em>inwit</em>,—a term made famous in the title of
a book (circa 1340) called the “Ayenbite of Inwit”
(that is, the “Again-bite or Remorse of Conscience”).
The concept of conscience has played
an important part in modern ethical theory, and it
is supposed by many persons to be the foundation
of all morality. What place it deserves to hold in
a constructive, mechanistic ethics can be determined,
however, only by careful analysis. So many extravagant
claims have been advanced in its behalf as
to make one suspect that none of them are true.
Things which people have “always heard lauded and
never discussed” are only with difficulty saved from
oblivion when intellectual revolutions have altered
the emphasis which man puts on the values of life.
It was thus with the word “soul,” and with the word
“immortality,” and it is likely to be the same with
the word “conscience.” At least it will be an advantage
to look at the philosophical pedigree of this
once mighty shibboleth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>It may be surprising to learn that as far as ethical
theory is concerned, the doctrine of an infallible conscience
is the product of no less recent a time than the
XVIII century. The Conscience-theory is the philosophical
property of such men as Butler, Clarke,
Kant, Shaftesbury, and Reid, rather than of their
predecessors. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), who
founded critical English ethics, flatly refused to give
to the then immature concept of conscience any recognition;
indeed, he declared it to be nothing less
than a “disease” of the state, and one “of those
things that weaken or tend to the dissolution of a
commonwealth.” In Chapter XXIX of the “Leviathan,”
he states the current notions of conscience:
(1) “That every private man is judge of good and
evil actions,” and (2) “That whatsoever a man does
against his conscience is sin.” Both of these notions
Hobbes condemns. “For,” he observes with characteristic
sagacity, “a man’s conscience and his judgment
is the same thing, and as the judgment so also
the conscience may be erroneous.”</p>

<p>This emphasis which Hobbes placed upon the untrustworthiness
of private ethical judgments was
fatal to his purpose. His successors began straightway
to reanimate that which he had sought to bury
once and for all, and, whether on account of their
temperamental antipathy to the intellectualism of
Hobbes, or because they were honestly seeking for
some valid ethical principle, they asserted, first timidly,
and later with a surprising boldness the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
thing which Hobbes had sought especially to efface
from the docket of ethical discussion.</p>

<p>We find this reaction beginning in Shaftesbury
(1671-1713). Albeit this author gives a minor
place in his ethical theory to the notion of a “moral
sense,” or rational, reflex affection which approves
only socially beneficial actions, yet the positive emphasis
which he puts upon it is nevertheless significant.
The affirmation proved to be contagious, for
those who followed Shaftesbury immediately elevated
conscience to a central position in their systems.
We refer here to Butler, Clarke, Kant, and
Reid, who are known as intuitionists.</p>

<p>According to Butler (1692-1752), conscience is
a “principle of reflection” and not a mere <em>feeling</em>.
And this principle of reflection is for him a natural
or inherent property of man’s mind. It is the principle
by which a man “approves or disapproves his
heart, temper, and actions”; it is a faculty which
“tends to restrain men from doing mischief to each
other, and leads them to do good.” Be it noted
here that Butler says nothing about the so-called infallibility
of conscience, nor does he argue that it
must be the same for all persons. Moreover, he
gives a somewhat analytical definition of it, and is
willing to grant that its function is utilitarian.</p>

<p>The old belief in the certainty of conscience now
begins to reappear. It was Clarke (1675—1729)
who attempted to defend it by the use of a mathematical
analogy. We are all familiar with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
axiom (or truism) that things which are equal to
the same thing are equal to each other. If now we
keep the general form, but alter the substance of
this axiom, so that it reads: “Whatever I judge
reasonable or unreasonable for another to do for me,
that by the same judgment I declare reasonable or
unreasonable that I in the like case should do for
him,” we have Clarke’s Law of Equity. To an
arm-chair philosopher such a statement sounds fairly
cogent, but its empirical value is not thereby guaranteed.
As every student of psychology knows,
individual differences, individual preferences, and
the capacity of individuals by this method of give-and-take
are completely ignored in the formulation
of this law. Besides, Clarke’s conception of conscience
may be said to contain a hint of ethical solipsism,
or the theory that oneself is the only accurate
authority on social justice. We need not pause
longer over the insuperable difficulties of such a
point of view.</p>

<p>It is, however, in the writings of Kant and Reid
that the conscience-theory attains its modern, sentimental
form. In his “Metaphysic of Morality”
Kant (1724-1804) makes the following straddling
assertion: “Nothing in the whole world, or even
outside of the world [sic!] can possibly be regarded
as good without limitation except a <em>good will</em>.” But
this is not the full extent to which this philosopher
presses his claims. For he continues, “A man’s
will is good, not because the consequences which flow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
from it are good, nor because it is capable of attaining
the ends which it seeks, but it is <em>good in itself</em>, or
because it wills the good. Its intrinsic value is in no
way increased by success or lessened by failure.”
From all of which Kant concludes that “As the will
must not be moved to act from any desire for the
results expected to follow from obedience to a certain
law, the only principle of the will which remains
is that of the conformity of actions to universal
law. In all cases I must act in such a way
that I can at the same time will that my maxim
should become a universal law.” This last statement
is the famous categorical imperative.</p>

<p>At first glance this appears to have profundity,
but it turns out even upon the slightest analysis to
be quite the opposite. For example, the first passage
quoted (“Nothing ... can be regarded as
good without limitation except a good will”) contains
assertions that nobody can know enough to
make. It is ritualistic philosophy. Moreover, the
expression “good will” actually does (Kant to the
contrary, notwithstanding) put a logical limitation
upon the concept <em>good</em>, just as “good” cat, or “good”
razor does. Besides, the term “will” or volition always
refers to a phenomenon which is strictly dependent
upon circumstances, for a man wills <em>only
when</em> there is something to be possessed. These
are not all the errors which Kant here commits.
His attempt to explain why the good will is good
(itself a statement exhibiting the fallacy of ambiguity)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
reveals that Kant was a very poorly equipped
psychologist. I ask you, how many persons is it
possible to find,—indeed, is it possible to find one
single man except among the psychopathic cases,—who
would ever be stimulated to live,—much less to
subscribe to Kant’s theory,—if his successes or failures
had no effect whatever upon his future volitions?
We do not imply by this rhetorical question
that every man is, or can be, or should be immoderately
egoistical, but only that Kant had no insight
whatever into the psychological problems involved
in ethics.</p>

<p>Consequently, the categorical imperative as a deduction
from Kant’s first principles is to be regarded
as completely erroneous. How, indeed, can a man
act in such a way as to make the maxim of his action
a universal law? Suppose we offer a simple example.
When I am hungry, and food is before me,
I eat it. Does this imply that my will to eat becomes
a universal law, namely, that all the hungry
should eat? But when I learn of the many hungry
who are unable to eat, my will to eat illustrates not
a universal law, but an extremely particular law,
that is to say, the law that <em>if</em> I am hungry, and <em>if</em>
food is supplied, and, furthermore, <em>if</em> I am willing
to risk that food, then, but only then, do I eat it.
There seems to be no way to establish the validity of
Kant’s imperative, regardless of the direction one’s
thought takes. To cite a different example entirely,
let us imagine a hungry man who, having cornered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
all the food of his tribe, eats it on the assumption
that every other man would do the same thing if he
were similarly fortunate. Here the categorical imperative
appears in such a light as to shock its author
profoundly. And yet in strict logic, this interpretation
is a valid one for an intuitionist ethics. Do we
wonder that Levy-Brühl speaks of “the ambiguous
and bastard concept of the moral law,” when they
who attempt to state such a law have neither comprehension
nor patience enough to discover the simplest
principles of human conduct?</p>

<p>It is, however, in the “Essays on the Active Powers
of Man,” by Thomas Reid (1710-1796) that
the commonplace notion of conscience receives its
principal philosophical support. Concerning this
“moral sense,” as Reid calls it in reminiscence of
Shaftesbury, the following formidable assertions are
made. In the first place, “It is without doubt far
superior to every other power of the mind.” In
the second place, “The testimony of this moral
sense,” like that of the rest of the senses, “is the
testimony of nature, and we have the same reason
to rely upon it.” In addition, just as the sense of
vision is fundamental for space perception, so “The
truths immediately testified by our moral faculty are
the first principles of all moral reasoning.” Reid
would also have us note that this reasoning is not
inductive, but deductive, for he says, “The first
principles of morals are the <em>immediate</em> dictates of
the moral faculty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>The outstanding fault of such a theory is that it
assumes that every name we choose to manufacture
has a reality corresponding to it. This is the fallacy
of hypostatization, to which all idealistic philosophers
are addicted. Granted that it is true, as
Butler says, that we approve and disapprove of
some of our actions, yet this does not imply that
there is a transcendent faculty within us which we
are at liberty to substantialize as Conscience or a
Moral Sense. Such language is merely noun-worship.
It is granted that the words “moral” and
“sense” have each separately a meaning, but it does
not follow that the compound term “moral-sense”
must therefore have one. Moreover, all of these
intuitionists are wilful and unperspicuous rationalists,
demanding a fundamental principle in ethics <em>before</em>
they have employed any induction or experimentation
that might help them to frame such a
principle correctly. They are willing to do no hard
work, and to perform no crucial tests in order to
see whether their guesses are facts or fictions. To
complete our criticism, we must not omit to state
that Reid’s elevation of conscience to a place among
the senses merely reveals the extent to which he was
willing to go in his defence of the testimony of the
senses in general against the idealists of his age.
His use of the “moral sense” was a debater’s trick.
The high esteem in which conscience was held by his
antagonists tempted him to turn one of their own
weapons against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>We can now better understand the statement previously
made that the personification of conscience
was the peculiar artifice, the “useful dodge,” of a
certain school of ethical thinkers in the XVIII century.
Consequently it is erroneous to suppose that
the commonplace view of this phenomenon has always
held undisputed sway over theoretical ethics.
It had no place whatever in the minds of Greek
ethical writers. Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and their
contemporaries founded the science of ethics without
even dreaming that there was a conscience.
Epictetus, Epicurus, and Marcus Aurelius showed
no poverty of constructive thought for the lack of it.
Even Helvetius, a contemporary of the intuitionists,
rejected it as spurious when he wrote: “He who
will warrant his virtue in every situation is either an
impostor or a fool; characters equally to be mistrusted.”</p>

<p>Most people who have heard the name of John
Locke will recall his arguments against the assumptions
of the moral intuitionists in those passages
where he combats the theory of innate moral ideas.
According to Locke, all such ideas would have to
be (1) independent of geographical location and
climate, (2) independent of the age of the person
and of his training, and (3) recognized by all persons
as fundamental. But none of these conditions
are found to be satisfied by anyone who makes the
shortest pilgrimage through the world in the search
for these statistics. And consequently the intellectually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
honest Locke rejects the philosophical theory
of conscience, independently of his recognition of the
facts of self-approval and self-disapproval.</p>

<p>It remained, however, for John Stuart Mill to
foreshadow the beginning of the end of this fantastic
theory of the moral faculty in Chapter III
of his “Utilitarianism.” He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The internal sanction of duty, whatever our standard
of duty may be, is one and the same—a feeling in our own
mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation
of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises,
in more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility.
This feeling ... is the essence of Conscience;
though in that complex phenomenon as it actually exists, the
simple fact is in general all encrusted over with collateral
associations, derived from sympathy, from love, and still
more from fear; from all the forms of religious feeling;
from the recollections of childhood and of all our past life;
from self-esteem, desire of the esteem of others, and occasionally
even self-abasement.”</p>
</div>

<p>This analysis of Mill’s reveals that what the intuitionists
loosely termed <em>conscience</em> is a far more complex
phenomenon than they had suspected, and with
this revelation the whole logical structure of intuitionism
breaks down. For if conscience is not the
simple, innate, infallible principle or faculty which
the intuitionists postulated it to be, the deductions
they made from this hypothesis become more and
more untenable the longer they are scrutinized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Mill’s analysis of the psychological factors in conscience,
together with Locke’s discovery of the cultural
and geographical limitations of any moral sense
make it necessary to define this ethical phenomenon
in purely empirical terms.</p>

<p>Such a definition as we seek, however, could only
be obtained by securing an elaborate census of cases
in which the words “conscience” or “moral sense”
were used. The census-taker would have to roam
over the whole earth, ask questions all day long,
and even become an eavesdropper at night, in order
to gain the information he desired. Even this
method would hardly be exhaustive, since perhaps
far more “pangs of conscience” are felt than are
ever expressed in language; and so our census-taker,
were he as thorough as we might desire him to be,
would have to be equipped with a sort of ultra-stethoscope,—one
that could elevate a blush into an
audible phenomenon,—in order to return with a
full and complete report. The lack of such exhaustive
statistics must, of course, be permanent; not
only for want of census-takers, and for want of accuracy
and sincerity on the part of those giving their
introspection, but also because the concept of conscience
may be slowly evolving, so that the end of
the census might not harmonize with its beginning.</p>

<p>Granting, indeed, that such an evolution exists, it
does not now appear to be either uniform or universal.
For while, as we have recently shown, the
concept of conscience first attained a philosophic importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in the XVIII century, and was thereafter
variously modified and developed, yet the popular
notion of a moral sense,—of “this deity within my
bosom,” as some have even expressed it,—has actually
degenerated into something unworthy of a
place among the positive ethical values. Our quotation
from James Murray’s account of the behavior
of the Adelie penguin is extremely pertinent here.
“<em>The fear of being found out</em>” is, we venture to say,
the very nucleus and core of the consciences of the
majority of men. And while without doubt some
forms of fear are well-grounded, as, for example,
the farmer’s fear lest the oncoming storm wash out
his seedlings, yet when fear tends to limit prudence,
or take the place of prevision, the organism in which
that fear arises is sub-normal and unsound. Conscience,
then, in so far as it is identical with this degrading
emotion of fear, and in so far as it begins
and ends in a withdrawing reaction, is nothing but
a blight.</p>

<p>Yet something more remains to be said about the
popular conception of the word “conscience.” This
word, as commonly used, denotes an emotional state
which, far from being in harmony with the ideals
of the group, often denotes the very opposite condition.
It is hardly necessary to remark that the fear
of being found out does not imply loyalty to the
group any more than it implies the recognition of
that which makes for power, wisdom, and peace in
the individual. Indeed, conscience as popularly experienced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
involving as it does anxiety, trepidation,
self-abasement, and a host of other introversive
tendencies, is an ethical liability, both to the group
and to the individual. The man who has transgressed
the will of the group is surely not a bit better
off because of his fear of being caught, nor can he
regard his fear, even though he has already been
tortured by it, as giving him any right to a mitigation
of the penalty. As for himself, the conscience-stricken
individual may have so long squandered his
energy in his effort to conceal his offence as to bring
him very close to ethical bankruptcy. The picture
we draw is not extreme,—it can be duplicated in
every neighborhood, if not in every family on the
globe. For conscience, as it is usually experienced,
is a painful, withdrawing reaction, implying negation
rather than affirmation, incoordination rather than
skilful prevision, and morbidity instead of frank,
overt, constructive action. Accurate indeed is the
phrase, “The pangs of conscience,” as a description
of the organic turmoil incident to this condition of
mal-adjustment. Can it not, then, be truthfully said,
that in the cases just described conscience is a pathological
phenomenon?</p>

<p>Thus to discover that the popular form of conscience
implies a vice rather than a virtue is not,
however, enough. We wish also to know how and
why this form of conscience has attained so great
a vogue. And here again we touch upon matters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
the greatest importance for a mechanistic ethics.</p>

<p>Conscience as a form of fear is so strong and so
wide-spread for two reasons. The first is already
familiar to us, and is briefly repeated. It is that
the flexor system is originally stronger than the extensor
system. And so in the great majority of
men whose natures are less evolved, fear is almost
a daily experience,—not only the fear of nature and
of the unknown, but also the fear of the group by
whose tolerance they exist. Moreover, sentiment
and not knowledge is the great group asset, by
which we imply no such educated sentiments as are
derived from analytical inquiry, or from an open
search after the facts, but rather that kind of sentiment
which passively bars and actively hinders the
enlargement of the understanding. The group
really never explains. When offended, it simply becomes
suspicious, and its gossips freely translate this
suspicion into rumor and inuendo. It is small wonder,
then, that the conscience-stricken individual, as
a product of his group, has as his first, and sometimes
his only reaction, the tendency to shrink and
become unresilient when he realizes that his acts, or
worse still, his thoughts, have transgressed the taboos
of his tribe. It is a case of like master, like
man; the group does not usually know what its purposes
are, much less does it ask to have those purposes
examined and revealed; and so the conscience-stricken
individual,—the sentimental child of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
group,—reacts to his realization of estrangement
from the group in a manner that makes his last
state worse than his first.</p>

<p>This cannot be taken to imply that it is a sign of
intellectual maturity to transgress all the taboos of
the group. Yet the argument still holds that the
influences produced by the exclusive use of this negative
form of conscience are baleful. Very early in
the life of the average child the expressions:
“Don’t,” “If you dare to do that again, I’ll whip
you,” “What would people say?” and a score of
other negations are employed by his parents and
teachers on the principle that ethical guidance is
achieved by such means. As a result, says Edwin
Holt, “The parent has set a barrier between the
child and a portion of reality; and forever after the
child will be in some measure impeded in its dealings”
with those things which have become taboo,
always first feeling the prohibition, rather than the
urgency to act discriminatively upon a knowledge
which a close contact with the reality should produce.
Such a parent has not “trusted the truth,” and the
final result is that the child has actually become “a
second-rate mind, not in harmony with itself,” since
not in creative touch with the environment.</p>

<p>Even more pointedly John Dewey writes in his
criticism of the doctrine of self-denial. “Morals is
a matter of direction, not of suppression. The urgency
of desires cannot be got rid of; nature cannot
be expelled. If the need of happiness, of satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
of capacity, is checked in one direction, it will
manifest itself in another. If the direction which
is checked is an unconscious and wholesome one, the
one which is taken will be likely to be morbid and
perverse. The one who is conscious of continually
denying himself cannot rid himself of the idea that
it ought to be ‘made up’ to him; that a compensating
happiness is due him for what he has sacrificed,
somewhat increased, if anything, on account of the
unnatural virtue he has displayed. To be self-sacrificing
is to ‘lay up’ merit, and this achievement
must surely be rewarded with happiness—if not now,
then later. Those who habitually live on the basis
of conscious self-denial are likely to be exorbitant in
the demands which they make on some one near
them, some member of their family or some friend;
likely to blame others if their own ‘virtue’ does not
secure for itself an exacting attention which reduces
others to the plane of servility. Often the doctrine
of self-sacrifice leads to an inverted hedonism; we
are to be good—that is, forego pleasure—now, that
we may have a greater measure of enjoyment in
some future paradise of bliss. Or, the individual
who has taken vows of renunciation is entitled by
that very fact to represent spiritual authority on
earth and to lord it over others.”</p>

<p>They who wish even a more striking picture of the
extent to which the negative type of conscience degrades
the intellect, have only to consult Alfred
Adler’s “The Neurotic Constitution.” If Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Adler correctly depicts the salient traits of the neurotic,
many intuitionists themselves are by implication
introverts, and consequently forfeit their claims to
ethical leadership. The neurotic is described as “a
person possessing anxiety,” “the self-sacrificing virtue,”
“a marked sensitiveness,” “an irritable debility,”
“an estrangement from reality,” as well as “a
person with a strong tendency to symbolization,”
and a penchant for “guiding fictions” invented for
the purpose of compensating him for his feeling of
inferiority at having lost solid contacts with reality.
This, then, is the success which the conscience-theory
has met with at the hands of scientific experts,—keen
and sympathetic observers of the ways of men.</p>

<p>Such an account of the degeneration of conscience
into a self-annihilating sentiment is, however, only
one chapter in the history of this concept. And
while the list of uses to which the word “conscience”
has been put does not furnish as solid a basis upon
which to build a constructive ethical technique as did
the uses of “good,” “right,” and “virtue,” we can
nevertheless still find a positive ethical value for
this term. How, then, will this value be discovered?</p>

<p>It will be found by a study of those persons who
have attained the power to view the world in a purely
objective and empirical manner; of those persons
who treat their own and other peoples’ actions as
experiments in the great laboratory of time, rather
than as timid ventures to be apologized for on the
slightest provocation; of those persons who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
evolved to that point where their knowledge determines
their sentiments, and not their sentiments
their knowledge; and of those who, having by this
means chosen their dependable goods, learn the
right methods to attain them, and thereafter employ
plain judgments of fact in estimating the success
which they acquire and the quality of the virtue
which they achieve. In such persons the positive,
constructive, liberalizing type of conscience exists,—a
conscience which, through being built up of objectively
tested judgments, becomes the outstanding
ethical asset of the personality.</p>

<p>This type of conscience is not a myth, for it may
be acquired in the same way as any other skill is
acquired. The objective knowledge which it presupposes
can be gained where every natural curiosity
of a child or an adult is developed into a frank acquaintance
with the object of curiosity; where fear
is turned into intrepidity by a bold analysis of its
cause and by a frontal attack upon the exciting stimulus;
where one learns that ethical problems are
always solved by forming serviceable habits and
never by the cultivation of permanent anxieties; and
where, finally, all the entangling alliances forced
upon one by unprofitable acquaintances are boldly,
but politely, annihilated. Even though many
strongly entrenched traditions and institutions of the
world would decay were the type of conscience we
here describe to become wide-spread, yet this cannot
deter the wise man from making it his life work to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
add as many new names to the list of those possessing
ethical insight as it is within his power to do.
Indeed, whenever this list becomes so large as to be
generally regarded by autocrats as dangerous, we
shall have come to that place in the course of
civilization where the first real ethical advance is to
be made.</p>

THE MITIGATION OF THE CONFLICT

<p>“There is a phrase ‘liberty of conscience’ which well expresses
the modern conception of moral obligation. It recognizes
that duty in the last analysis is imposed upon the

that there is no authority in moral matters more ultimate
than a man’s own rational conviction of what is best.”</p>

</div>


<p>One of the most revolutionary changes which the
scientific study of psychology has wrought consists
in the demolition of all the barriers which formerly
divided the body from the mind. The intellect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
once securely enthroned as the highest faculty in the
mental hierarchy; the reason, erstwhile religiously
devoted to the contemplation of pure truth; and the
will, which formerly completed this trio of sublime,
unitary faculties, have, in the unbiased and careful
scrutiny of laboratory science, been shown to be not
only highly complicated processes, but products of
experience as well; and not only products of experience,
but functions of brain and gland. Furthermore,
they have been revealed to be not solely functions
of a biological mechanism controlled by external
stimuli, but also in a larger sense they are now
regarded as means by which the body of a man adjusts
itself to and gains control of its physical and
social environments. No longer do we ask the old
question: “Why has the mind a body?” but rather,
“Why does the body have a mind?” And the answer
is: The body has a mind to enable the body
to experiment with its environment so that when it
gets what it seems to want, it can know that it has
really wanted what it has gotten.</p>

<p>Some results of this highly reconstructive iconoclasm
upon ethical thought have already been depicted
in the preceding chapters. Here we are soon
to see what effect such a doctrine has upon the last
two ethical concepts we shall analyze, namely, duty
and freedom.</p>

<p>As may have already been divined, a mechanistic
ethics on its constructive side does not maintain a
pension list for the outworn conceptions of an earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
day. Consequently, in this place we shall not ask
what used to be thought of the “Freedom of the
Will,” nor shall we quote Wordsworth’s “Ode to
Duty” as a prologue to our theme. For while only
a hundred years ago no ethical teacher could have
safely omitted giving great emphasis to the theological
setting of these two concepts, today such a treatment
would not arouse the slightest “problematic
thrill.” What used to be called “the Will” is now
an obsolete expression;—indeed, ever since Spinoza
wrote, it has been regarded as a myth. In its stead,
we speak of the individual or particular volitions
of men, and we discuss their value in reducing the
gap between our liquid matter and its good. Likewise,
what was once called the lump-sum of our
Duty has now become separated and analyzed into
claims, interests, other-regarding sentiments, and the
like, each one of which has a history and a real
meaning for our flesh-and-blood personality.</p>

<p>All such changes, while perhaps highly disconcerting
to those persons who feel that they cannot get
along without their “guiding fictions,” are really
signs of a salutary advance along ethical lines. Once
it is realized that what is popularly termed “will-power”
is after all only <em>skill-power</em>, and that “moral
obligation” should be translated into <em>pragmatic urgency</em>,
it will be plain that only clearly-prevised
action-tendencies can properly be called either right
or virtuous. It may be true that many a successful
action has been performed in the name of a fetichistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
belief, but who will doubt that an even more
profitable action could have been motivated with
less waste of the body’s energies, had there been correct
insight and a frank facing of the facts. As
long as people are afraid of life, so long are they
bound to allege some false cause of their actions.
Conversely, as soon as they realize that they <em>are</em>
what they <em>do</em>, and whenever they learn that their
ethical books cannot be balanced by drawing on a
phantom bank account, they begin to pile up ethical
assets, and to reduce their ethical liabilities.</p>

<p>From our earlier remark that the science of ethics
is primarily concerned with what <em>is</em> rather than what
<em>ought to be</em>, it may be difficult to imagine what place
the concept of human freedom can have in a mechanistic
treatment of the problems of conduct. It might
seem easier to foreshadow what will be the fate of
the concept of obligation, especially when we realize
that oughting is always hypothetical, rather than
categorical. For every obligation is specific and
particular,—it depends upon conditions, places,
times, and persons, just as does every signification of
good and bad, and right and wrong. There is no
general Ought, as our recent discussion of Kant’s
categorical imperative clearly implied. When, then,
we ask from whom or from what obligation arises,
what answer does a mechanistic ethics provide?
Some may expect us to make the traditional answer,
namely, that it comes from the group, and that the
<em>feeling</em> of obligation is a variation of the elemental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
type of conscience. This sort of an answer is not
to be given here. Although the group largely determines
how we shall feel with regard to what <em>ought</em>
to be done, yet the final education of an ethically
adult person leaves him with a different mind on this
point. Indeed, it is our purpose here not only to
show that the concept of ethical freedom is a valid
concept for a mechanistic ethics, but also and more
particularly that a true conception of ethical obligation
depends upon the discovery of what ethical
freedom implies. That this involves no paradox
will be understood as soon as we comprehend what it
means to say that a man is <em>free</em>. Herewith we shall
state five conditions under which freedom of action
is guaranteed.</p>

<p>The first meaning of free action is <em>action that is
physically possible</em>. I am not now, I never was, and
I never shall be free (that is, able) to walk backward
and forward at the same time, or to be in
Boston and New York simultaneously. Neither can
I, while kissing Jennie at her fireside, be also kissing
Kate at her doorway a mile from Jennie’s house.
On the other hand, the man who is sound of limb,
sensorially acute, and otherwise endowed with natural
capacities, can be said to be free to employ
these capacities whenever and wherever the conditions
provide the opportunity.</p>

<p>Right here we ask whether this first meaning of
freedom does not have an important bearing on the
question of ethical obligation. Is it, indeed, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
plain that just as we cannot do what is physically
impossible, so there is no valid obligation under
these conditions? This, however, is something
which the intuitionists and the idealists have persistently
ignored, regarding it often as somehow the
very acme of virtue to declare as an ideal of conduct
something which is totally impossible of realization,
and thereby fostering the neurotic temperament instead
of ethical enlightenment. Yet it is plain that
if, while being unable to do the impossible, I still
am pathologically anxious about it, I shall succeed
only in accumulating impatience and turmoil, and be
forced to get what sour consolation I can from
Schopenhauer, or else to “gnaw the file” in some
other fashion. Moreover, according to a mechanistic
ethics, I am an evil person as long as I waste
energy in this fashion, or in demanding consolation
for my erroneous sentiment. Not only am I bound
to fail, and thereby to create discord rather than
relieve it, but I am also losing time and energy which
might have gone into more profitable pursuits. On
the other hand, while we do not yet say that we are
under obligation to perform every physically possible
action, yet every valid urgency still lies in that
direction.</p>

<p>The second meaning of the word “freedom” is
<em>absence of external restraints</em> imposed by physical
obstacles or generated by human beings. No man
is free to act when external hindrances are too great
for him to overcome. Thus while it is possible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
a sound man to walk either forward or backward,
he cannot keep on walking in a straight line if his
path is intercepted by the sheer wall of a hundred-foot
cliff, or if some one stronger than himself obstructs
his going. Excellent examples of such
thwarting occur in the Greek mythology of Hades.
Tantalus was forever hindered by the gusts of wind
from plucking the fruit from the tree; Sisyphus could
not force the stone over the brow of the hill; and
the daughters of Danaus lost all the water they
carried in their sieves. They were not, therefore,
<em>free</em> to perform these actions. They may, it is true,
have everlastingly <em>wished</em> them, but they could not
<em>will</em> them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while many similar hindrances to
human action exist, such as the friction-hindrance to
perpetual motion, and the wall which kept Pyramus
from Thisbe, yet, on the whole, most of the so-called
external restraints are far less serious barriers to
freedom than we realize. This is not only attested
by the magnificent conquests of nature recently made
by applied science, but it might also be deduced from
the properties of man’s protoplasm as modified in
his muscular architecture. For protoplasm is liquid,
and liquids flow; and man’s stream of thought as a
derivative of his liquid protoplasm acquires its labile
character as a sort of natural right. Just as a
liquid under pressure transmits that pressure in all
directions, so a man who is made of good protoplasm
tends, when confronted by such obstacles as we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
just described, to think, and plan, and experiment,
that is, TO FLOW, out of the difficulty. His
neuro-muscular equipment also singularly facilitates
the turning of his wish into a will. Our muscles do
not only contract and relax to produce lever movements
in one plane, but they also combine their
movements into pronation, supination, and rotation,
and these synergic actions enable us to explore the
obstacle and almost literally to flow around it. This
is also the mechanism by which we puzzle out any
problem. The all-or-none principle makes mental
analysis always possible and often accurate. Applied
to Pyramus, this means that the wall that separates
him from Thisbe stimulates him with her aid
so variously that he not only rebels and laments,
but also starts to explore its surface and its possibilities,
with the final result that he vaults it and
descends “until he can come at Thisbe’s lips more
directly.” There has always been an abundance of
old saws to encourage the bold and the faint-hearted
to regard obstacles as merely stepping-stones to
future success, but the physiological basis of such
maxims we are only beginning to comprehend. In
fine, then, when we speak of a permanent obstacle
to our actions, we mean it only in so far as we do
not also imply some serious deficiency in the quality
of our protoplasm.</p>

<p>The relation between this second type of freedom
and obligation is very obviously hinted at by the
popular maxims on the theme of perseverance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Moreover, it is historically demonstrable that
pragmatic urgency usually increases in direct ratio
to the ease with which external restraints can be surmounted.
On the other hand, it is gradually becoming
recognized that “there are hundreds of thousands
of human beings who can by no possibility ever
do what is expected of them by society. Society
must give over expecting such things.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Those who
have no power to plan, scheme, or supervise, are
consequently not educated enough to appreciate the
obligations which such abilities involve.</p>

<p>We may now consider a third meaning of the concept
“freedom.” <em>It is exhibited in those actions
which we have been so well trained to perform that
they occur without any conscious effort whatever.</em>
Accordingly, the man with training and skill is more
free than the man who lacks these abilities. If the
oboist of a symphony orchestra is too sick to play,
only another oboist is free to sit as a substitute at
his desk. A plumber will not do. It will be perceived
at once that many sorts of skill, even though
they be the exclusive possession of one person, may
yet be turned to the equal advantage of a great
number of people, making them all co-sharers in his
freedom. By using the skill of the substitute oboist,
for example, both the managers and the patrons
of the concert are free to carry out their wishes.
The enormous social advantages of most forms of
skilful technique require only a passing comment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Indeed, what we call business and trade are ultimately
the bargains we make for each other’s skill.
And here again the pragmatic urgency implicated
by this form of freedom is apparent, not only in the
sharing of socially profitable skill, but also in the
acquisition of it.</p>

<p>A fourth empirical characterization of freedom
may now be considered. For free actions, in addition
to those which are physically possible, externally
unhindered, and within the range of our skill,
are especially <em>those which some mechanism of the
body actually carries out in the manner in which it
was originally set to do it</em>. In popular speech this
form of freedom is exemplified by such expressions
as, “I was successful,” “I was determined to do it,
and I did it,” or, “The clerk tried to palm off a substitute,
but I persevered in getting the original.”
Such freedom emphatically implies a <em>continuity in
behavior</em> which is absent in cases where the desire
is thwarted or suppressed. The physiological processes
which guarantee this form of freedom are
interesting to contemplate. As the wish passes over
into will, not only are more and more muscle fibers
involved in the action-scheme stimulated to their
maximum contraction, but also wider and wider
synergies of muscular groups are brought into play,
until all the available kinetic energy of the body is
released along the channel of one final common
motor pathway. Moreover, each and every muscle
involved in such an action-scheme stimulates, upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
its contraction, a receptor nerve embedded within it,
and these circular reflex stimulations automatically
reinforce the contractions already begun. This is
nature’s own contribution to the unification of our
personality in the performance of this type of free
activity. The whole neuro-muscular architecture involved
in such behavior becomes an automatic mechanism
for reinforcing the centrifugal bodily posture,
and for providing against the wilting of any
motor discharge in any single muscle due to its prolonged
contraction. Such actions, then, which involve
the steady and uninhibited output of energy
that we have described we call <em>free</em>. They are
equally manifested by the cat who springs upon and
catches the mouse she has been warily watching, and
by the violoncello virtuoso who scurries safely
through the cadenza and arrives at the <em>tutti</em> without
having either produced a “wolf tone” or dropped
his bow. It is such action which is connoted by
the popular phrase “free will.”</p>

<p>The final touch to our delineation of freedom may
be added by saying that <em>only when a man’s actions
result in enlarging his environment, and in providing
him with increasing opportunities for turning his
wishes into wills, is he in the highest sense ethically
free</em>. The preceding characterizations of the free
man were derived from simply watching him <em>in the
midst</em> of any of a thousand activities. This last
part of the picture is obtained by reckoning the permanent
ethical assets which his efforts have provided.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
These assets are, moreover, defined in terms of a
continuing freedom. For while we are all in a
sense free to do anything within our ability, and for
which there is the time, the place, and the opportunity,
yet only under certain conditions can we follow
such an action with another of our own choosing.
The liar, the thief, and the slanderer know very well
to what an extent their putative freedoms produce
antagonists of their own making with whom they
must ever thereafter wage a dismal conflict. On the
other hand, the man of frankness and a truthful
tongue, the man who makes fair bargains with the
universe, and the man who can solve his problems
without the loss of his own temper or the respect of
other persons, is ipso facto equipped with the ability
to synergize his muscles repeatedly into freely willed
activities. Moreover, while this fifth type of freedom
is dependent upon the presence of the other
four, its effect upon them is reflexively beneficial, in
making more actions physically possible, reducing
the external hindrances to them, increasing the skill
by which they are performed, and insuring the continuity
with which they are carried out. Indeed, we
may now identify virtue with the attainment of this
last type of freedom, and vice with its loss or decline.
Such activity is also right, and its stimulus is
a dependable good.</p>

<p>In thus defining the conditions under which human
freedom exists, we have, I surmise, also discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the secret of ethical obligation, of pragmatic urgency.
That is to say, whenever an action is possible, when
it is not opposed by restraints beyond a man’s power
to overcome, when he has the skill with which to
perform it, and when he can will it as well as wish
it, and when also the performance of this action increases
the range of his effectiveness, then, but not
till then, can it be said that he <em>ought</em> to perform it.
The expressions, “I ought,” or “I should,” henceforth
mean: “I imagine that there would be
greater freedom if this course of action which I contemplate
were to be carried out.” Under this new
conception of pragmatic urgency, oughting is neither
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis a tergo</i>, nor a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis a fronte</i>, nor yet Somebody’s
fiat superadded to the data of ethics, but it is simply
the logical resultant of the conditions of such human
activity as produces dependable goods. We recognize
no valid obligations imposed upon men from
above; obligations are rather implicit in any activity
which employs a man’s skill to satisfy his needs at
the same time that it educates his desires.</p>

<p>It is thus plain that there is no fundamental difference
between ethics and any other science. Just
as the business of physical science is to describe the
conditions under which any phenomenon occurs, so
the business of ethical science is to ascertain, by a
study of the mechanisms of human behavior, the
conditions which underlie all of our ethical values.
Wisely indeed did Protagoras remark that “Man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the measure of all things,” but it was not until many
centuries after this statement had been made that a
positively constructive interpretation, could be put
upon it.</p>

<p>Little did Descartes dream that his attempt to
find truth by the method of candid doubting was a
sign that human evolution had “turned a corner,” or
that the method he employed was to be the precursor
of an ethical renaissance. Yet the introduction
of this one form of psychological test as a philosophic
instrument was an entering wedge of such
power that where great darkness had been, much
light was shed; and where the stolid inertia of many
centuries had existed, movement and life and enlightenment
began to appear. But nature is slow,
and always takes plenty of time to play its elaborate
game; indeed, often nature seems to us to proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
by circuitous paths where we would make an open
right of way. However, even though it was several
centuries after Descartes before the first psychological
laboratory was founded, the development of
thought toward the recognition and use of the psychological
method was nevertheless steadily proceeding.
Today there is no word we are more wont to
conjure with than the word <em>psychology</em>. And even
if the foolish always use it with derision, yet those
who are wise know well to what an extent it is
symbolical of a new era of human development, on
the threshold of which era we now confidently stand.</p>

<p>What is this psychological method which has so
silently become established, and what has it to do
with the acquisition of an ethical technique? It is
the method of analysis, experiment, and constructive
scepticism, which treats all phenomena objectively,
that is, by leaving out the personal equation, and by
asking not how do we preconceive that things <em>should</em>
appear, but only how <em>do</em> they appear with our personal
bias in abeyance.</p>

<p>Such a method, which, by the way, is the essence
of psychological science, is very difficult to achieve.
Indeed, for many it is constitutionally impossible.
The history of physical science records how great
were the struggles of men to become objectively-minded
even toward their external environment,
struggles which have only recently become successful.
Witness the fact that for many centuries the
alchemists sought for the philosopher’s stone, a mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
which they falsely preconceived to have the
power of transmuting lead into gold; witness the fact
that the science of anatomy was for generations denied
its birth on account of pious prejudice and
taboo; and witness even today that many physical
objects are said to be <em>bewitched</em> when they fail to
operate as expected, and that luck at cards is still
stoutly affirmed by otherwise estimable people. Indeed,
there are thousands of farmers in the United
States who appeal to the methods of divination in
planting their crops and shingling their houses.
Consequently, it is plain that if the power to become
objectively-minded toward the physical world is so
rarely attained, it is even more difficult to become
detached and un-self-conscious toward the mental
and social behavior of our fellow-men. Nevertheless,
this method of detachment, of looking at old
things with new eyes, is just what hundreds of
teachers of psychology are training thousands of
students every year to employ; and its salutary effects
are being felt in every corner of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>To some persons all this may come as a surprise,
since the criticism has already been publicly uttered
that the study of psychology tends to make one incurably
introspective. On these grounds alone the
self-styled hard-headed business man often hastily
classifies psychology among the foibles of women and
poets. This, however, is simply another error due
to hostile preconceptions. For even though some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
psychologists have fallen into the practice of cultivating
Psyche for her own sake, yet their method
originated from distinctly other motives. Psychology,
it is true, when cultivated by persons constitutionally
possessed of an introversive bias, may not
always eradicate that bias, any more than will the
putting of an army rifle into the hands of a timid
man make him forthright into a model top-sergeant.</p>

<p>In another strain, it is sometimes alleged that
psychology is simply a new head set upon the body
of ancient Roman stoicism. But it must be remembered
that the detachment which the Stoics cultivated
lacked all the elements of a scientific inquisitiveness.
It was marked chiefly by a sweet indifference
and unconcern, traits which were derived from
the belief that Reason which ruled the world was
interested only in the headlines of universal news.
The psychologist, far from being indifferent to the
most transient phenomena of human experience,
regards them most steadfastly. Nevertheless, he
endeavors to maintain an equality of interest in all
human affairs, knowing full well that as soon as he
takes sides, he loses his sense of the proportions of
the whole. Unlike the Stoic, he admits the reality
and inevitableness of pain and anguish; yet while he
studies these phenomena, he keeps a sharp lookout
lest his personal equation obtrude itself in the shape
of sympathetic sorrows,—these he steadfastly refuses
to add to his report of the objective facts.
Nevertheless, it is conceivable that had not the elements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
of stoic indifference been a basic capacity of
human protoplasm, the psychological attitude might
not have been evolved.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, psychology has been both defended
and attacked on the basis of its supposed
kinship with certain doctrines of Jesus, as, for example,
the Golden Rule. No psychologist is
greatly interested in any debate carried out on these
lines. When Edwin Holt’s “The Freudian Wish”
first appeared a few years ago, some caustic reviewer
accused its author of “having gotten religion in the
form of Freud.” It is doubtful whether anyone,
be he Christian or non-Christian, would regard such
a remark either as a help or a hindrance to the acceptance
of psychology as a contribution to the
technique of ethics. As far as the Golden Rule is
concerned, its relations to scientific method may be
briefly indicated by saying that while this maxim can
be interpreted to imply a kind of other-regard which
seems to possess the elements of scientific detachment,
yet other things must also be considered before
final judgment is passed. For this hypothetical
imperative,—“<em>Whatsoever ye would</em> that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them,”—is
only possible of application among equals of intellect
or of sentiment, and it can be used then only by a
forehanded and judicious person, one with discriminative
sympathies, and able to mature his wishes
into wills. Psychology ventures to make no universal
rules of conduct, especially since it must first take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
an inventory of human nature in order to find out
what rules there are to which man will give his uncoerced
and unconscious loyalty.</p>

<p>Let it not be assumed, however, that the psychologist
urges an ethical moratorium while he is
pursuing his search into the secret places of human
nature. The method of scientific detachment has
itself provided such an insight into the problems of
conduct as to make any such assumption absurd.
He who catches a glimpse of what it means to understand
his fellow-men, rather than to regard them
primarily as creatures to be classified as either good
or bad, virtuous or vicious, begins to grow into an
ethically adult person. He at once loses that
ancient, clandestine, stultifying tendency to obtrude
his own bias into his social environment, and he
no longer finds his chief comfort in adoring
those who are most like unto himself, or in mentally
lynching in advance those who rub his ego the wrong
way. Scientific neutrality hath also its victories.
The application of the psychological method to
prison reform, where the criminal is regarded as an
effect as well as a cause of social mal-adjustments,
has already been acknowledged as humanly great.
Is it not possible that we see in such phenomena the
passing of an age in which maxims were necessary,
and the birth of an era where the educative methods
of wise and kind men will take their places?</p>

<p>The further drift of this would be hard, indeed,
to conceal. Ethics as a branch of psychology is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
inevitably bound up with the abolition of praise and
blame, and of reward and punishment, as the chief
themes in the judgments we pass upon our fellow-men.
The tendency to make such bi-polar judgments
usually implies a prejudice inherited from a pre-scientific
age. With this change, of course, many of
the traditional moral categories will be replaced by
the true categories of the understanding,—categories
derived from psychological insight into the
ethical potentialities of the natural man. Even
now, however, such a replacement is in progress, the
results of which are neither small nor unimportant.</p>

<p>We refer here to the wide-spread use of trait
analyses, both in business and in education, by which
a man is estimated on the basis of his tendencies,
capacities, and powers. His body is measured for
its strength and resiliency, and where defects are
discovered, a regimen leading to the re-education of
his physique is prescribed. His mental developments
are tested, and the common attributes of the
human mind, such as sensory acuity, retention, discrimination,
and the like, are estimated and recorded.
The special talents he possesses are revealed
by performance tests, and his hitherto undeveloped
potentialities are induced to betray themselves.
The emotions from which he either profits
or suffers are discovered by methods adroitly devised
for the purpose. Likewise, the individual’s sociability,—whether
it be merely gang-attachment, or a
zest for cooperative endeavors,—is made a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of sympathetic study; while still other bases upon
which a man may be estimated are employed in the
attempt to help him find out just what manner of
man he is.</p>

<p>While it is admitted that physical and mental
tests are often stupidly devised and bigotedly inflicted
on the testee, yet it seems likely that we have
given here a method which can be employed to the
greatest advantage even in every-day ethics. For
the psychological method, in that it teaches one first
to become analytical and discriminative, replaces
the old, unfounded prejudice that men are unequivocally
either good or bad, virtuous or vicious,
saints or sinners, by a desire to know just what can
be done with and for them. And while the methods
of psychology will probably always rank men on a
scale from low to high, and will always employ opposite
poles in its judgments, yet in the multitude of
such antonyms there is safety. Scientific judgments
are, by being unemotional, devoid both of that extreme
congratulation and sharp censure which attach
to purely moral estimates, while the wide
range of observation upon which they are made
provides for the greatest number of human contacts
and of educative measures possible. To extol a
man is often not much different in effect than to
blame him, and both praise and blame can equally
hinder his power to acquire an ethical technique.
Men differ too variously to be fitted to any one
Procrustean bed; the human mind has infinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
more than two dimensions. Moreover, the moralist’s
use of bi-polar judgments tends inevitably to
separate men, rather than to unite them, or to teach
them to cooperate with one another. And when we
consider that from now on, at least, the predicaments
of this planet will be common liabilities of the
whole human race, the pragmatic urgency to employ
the methods of psychology in attaining social harmony
are undisguisedly patent.</p>

<p>The benefits derived from employing the psychological
method in ethics are, however, by no
means exclusively social. The use of this method
reacts directly upon the user in several significant
ways. In the first place, the man who employs even
as few as twenty-five of the newer categories in making
a trait analysis of his fellows, soon becomes
aware of the fact that his former analysis of himself
is in need of revision. Exaggerated self-preference is
thus broken down, and replaced, not by its opposite,—self-abasement,—but
by an estimate which
arises from comparisons and contrasts resulting
from the use of an objective standard. Again, the
user of this method learns that human behavior is
not the product of some mysterious mental element
called “character,” but that character itself is the
product of traits, and, furthermore, that every trait
has had a developmental history, which is at every
point a record of the effect of environmental stimulus
upon original nature. His own character thereafter
becomes subject to scientific scrutiny, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
realizes, for example, that his previous emotional
repugnances were not always signs of incorruptibility,
but very frequently, indeed, signs of the extent
to which his own desires had been prevented
from reaching their maturity. And, only to mention
one more of the many benefits of such new scientific
insight, the use of this method reveals that times out
of number purely moral judgments are employed to
quench, rather than to quicken thought, and are uttered
not so much to indicate that discriminative
sympathies are being acquired, as to show that they
have long since ceased to germinate. Henceforth
the employment of the psychological method goes
hand in hand with the urgency to prevent as many
young minds as possible from suffering on account of
a retarded development.</p>

<p>Such a change of emphasis from traditional
morals to scientific methods implies unequivocally
that the problems of ethics are henceforth to be
solved by experts. Already the recognition of the
need of such a change is evident in the reliance that
is being placed upon psychiatrists and other medical
men to assist in the cure of those who are maladjusted
to their environment. Health-clinics likewise
are being both promoted and attended by those
who realize that the virtues go as deep as the
viscera, and that often such things as ignorance of
the shape of one’s stomach have been the source of
many a lapse from normality. This reliance upon
trained experts is, moreover, a sign of still further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
changes in our occidental philosophy of life. It
means that we are acquiring the conviction that constructive
criticism is better than ritual, and analysis
more efficacious than prayer. For we have begun
to see that progress must come by honest, painstaking
efforts in the here and now, rather than by presuming
upon the perfection of a universe which we
have only begun to understand. It is indeed the well-born
sentiment of many thousands of people today
that science wisely employed for the benefit and use
of men is the only true word of God.</p>

<p>Herewith, also, the question of what sort of
ideals an applied mechanistic psychology of conduct
provides may have an answer. On this point we
need not be dumb, nor can we make a “sentimental
compromise.” When the mechanist asserts that we
<em>are</em> what we <em>do</em>, he does not thereby denounce
ideals; on the contrary, he thus only affirms his purpose
to take the whole question of ideals seriously,
more seriously, in fact, than it was ever taken before.
Herein also he declares for the Ethics of
Hercules rather than the “Ethics of Cinderella.”
For while he must admit that there is, accordingly,
no class of people who can be truthfully said to be
“the pure in heart,”—owing to the fatigue of attention
incident to all other-worldly contemplation,—yet
he also asserts that the man who knows his capacities
and powers as the result of an objective analysis,
is by that means equipped to advance to more inclusive
levels of conduct than he who merely cultivates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
an inner life of private mystery. The
mechanist would therefore let new standards grow
out of the development of natural human capacities,
out of the struggle to educate men so that their
desires and abilities mature simultaneously, and out
of the freedom which can thus be achieved by those
able to achieve it.</p>

<p>“Great love comes from great knowledge,” said
Leonardo da Vinci, and the advance of science today
in all its branches corroborates this assertion. Although
at the present hour it does not seem clear
just what the universe is doing, yet they who recognize
even in seemingly disastrous tumults the
struggles of man to enlarge his power to think,
will see that even if nature’s way appears to be circuitous
and even at times crude, it is nevertheless
nature’s inevitable way. Much lamentation is heard
today over the changes which evolution has brought
to this planet, and the outcry is even raised that
science has taken away our souls. Is it necessary to
reply that a faith in stagnation is clearly out of
joint with the creative functions of time, or that
the loss of an ancient belief may be the sign of a
truly ethical advance? Indeed, we can well be assured
that the type of soul which is composed of self-stifled
desires, of restless sentiments due to an ignoble
retreat from reality, of the fear of ultimate
annihilation, not only <em>will</em> die, but it also <em>ought</em> to
die. There is another and a better kind of soul,—the
one created out of sagacity, skill, and kindness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
which generates power, wisdom, and peace,—and
this type of soul, as long as the sun remains hot, and
the earth’s crust keeps flowering into men, will have
its immortality guaranteed. This is the mechanist’s
religion,—a consequence of, rather than an apology
for, his ethics. For religion, though it be a word
made base by those who claim to have an endless
copyright on truth, and a retroactive monopoly on
the deeper human emotions, means to a mechanist
something more closely allied to its original signification.
It means a reliance on that much of nature,
and a support from that much of humanity, as contributes
to the development of a man’s talents, to the
freedom of his actions, and to his peace of mind.
The new labors of Hercules will consist in making
this true for the whole human race.</p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">12mo, Cloth 210 pages</p>

<p>A strictly behavioristic treatment of ethical values. Not
only is human conduct the result of external and internal
stimuli upon the human body, but even our notions of right

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
